<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In the ordinary course of events, most individuals
take some part in the manifold industries
which engage the mind and the hand of man, by
which alone our present-day civilization can be
maintained. These great world activities touch
the daily life of <i>every</i> member of society,
whether child or adult, worker or idler.</p>

<p>A chain of mutual dependence, too often unrecognized,
binds together the members of the
human family, whether they belong to the same
community or dwell on opposite sides of the
earth. The links of this chain are made up of
the articles which constitute our daily food, our
clothing, homes, fuel, light, our means of communication
and transportation, and only by continuous
coöperation are they kept together.</p>

<p>The highest motive in education is to present
the conditions which will lead to the most complete
living; to build up the best possible members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of society; to develop character. An
individual who does not understand the life of
which he finds himself a part, cannot be in full
sympathy with its conditions and hence cannot
be of the most service to himself or to others.
Only to the extent that education and life follow
the same general course, can each be truly successful.
Far too little is done in our schools to
acquaint children with their relations to the
great industrial and social organization of which
they are members. Even grown persons have,
as a rule, a very indefinite knowledge of these
relations.</p>

<p>It is a recognized principle that our knowledge
of geography has its foundation in our knowledge
of the home. The natural connecting link
between the immediate surroundings and the
outside world is the <i>present daily life of the
home</i>. Through the industries seen in the community,
the commodities in general use, and the
history of their creation and supply, the pupil
acquires an insight into the life about him as
well as into that of other parts of the world.
He also realizes the great truth that the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
and its people are in intimate touch with <i>him</i>.
In this way he is led back and forth along the
routes which civilization has followed in its
progress, which it also follows to-day, as mankind
clasp hands across oceans and continents.
Thus the remote and abstract become immediate
and concrete. Facts are seen in a setting of
reason, and a logical and interesting basis for
the study of physical, climatic, and human conditions
is furnished.</p>

<p>This study begins with the commodities in
constant use and finally encompasses the whole
world, but always with the home as the base of
operations. It will create a knowledge of the
interdependence of individuals, communities, and
nations, and a genuine respect for the work of
the hands and for the worker. The importance
of this respect is not likely to be overestimated.
Without it a true democracy cannot long exist.</p>

<p>Reading should not only serve for the acquisition
and the expression of the thought contained
in the printed page; it should, in addition, stimulate
to <i>new</i> thought&mdash;to independent power in
reasoning. On this account questions are inserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
which the pupil is left to answer. These
are suggestive of a much larger number, which
should be worked out by the teacher. Too
many of the questions found in books do not
"stimulate thought" or "independent power in
reasoning." They are purely informatory and
not at all formative.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made to treat every
article of food. Those in most general use, as
well as those which will best serve to develop a
knowledge of geographical conditions and of
man's relation to man, have been chosen.</p>

<p>A given industry is pursued in somewhat different
ways in different places. It has not been
thought wise to describe each modification in
these pages. For example, the method of handling
wheat in California is different from that
employed in Minnesota. The value of the work
will be increased if the teacher will bring out
these points.</p>

<p><i>All places mentioned should he definitely located</i>,
both as to position on the map or globe
and with reference to the home. When developed
from the standpoint of direct, personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
interest, a knowledge of the location of places
as well as of other facts mentioned is most
likely to be retained.</p>

<p>The illustrations used have been very carefully
selected for their <i>teaching value</i>. They
give a clearness to mental pictures which can be
derived only through observation of that which
the illustrations symbolize. Much experience in
the use of geographical illustrations has shown
that pupils need to be directed in their examination
of them. To secure the best results they
must be made the centers of thought-developing
questions.</p>

<p>Thanks are due the Pillsbury-Washburn Flour
Mills Company of Minneapolis, the Swift Packing
Company of Chicago, the Walter Baker
Company of Dorchester, the United Fruit Company
of New Orleans, and Dr. Charles U. Shepard
of Pinehurst Plantation, for the excellent
illustrations furnished by them.</p>

<h2>HOW WE ARE FED</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE PAST AND THE PRESENT</h2>


<p>Long, long ago people did not live as we do
to-day. Their homes were very different from
ours, for they were made of the skins of wild
animals, of the limbs and bark of trees, or of tall
grasses. There were no stoves, chairs, tables, or
beds in their houses. Instead of lamps, gas,
or electricity, a fire on the dirt floor or in front
of the house, furnished the light.</p>

<p>The clothing of these people was as simple
as their homes. It was made of skins and
furs in cold countries and in warm countries of
braided grasses and the fibers of certain plants.
You may be sure that tailors and dressmakers
were not consulted as to the latest styles, for the
styles did not change and there were neither
tailors nor dressmakers to talk to. Each family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
made its own clothing, and there was not a
sewing machine to be found.</p>

<p>How would you like to use a bone for a
needle? Sometimes, instead of sharpened bones,
long thorns were used. The sinews of the deer,
or of some other animal, usually furnished the
thread.</p>

<p>When the people were in need of food, they
went into the forest and gathered roots, nuts,
and fruits. Wild animals were killed by
means of such weapons as bows and arrows
and spears, and fish were caught in the lakes
and streams.</p>

<p>The food was not cooked as ours is; for, as
I have told you, there were no stoves. Sometimes
the meat was broiled over the fire, sometimes
baked in a hole filled with ashes and coals,
but it was often eaten raw. It was not easy
to have a variety of food, and there were
times when it was very difficult to obtain
anything. When food was abundant, the
people feasted, and when it was scarce, they
were often hungry. How would you like to
wait for your breakfast while your father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
went to the woods or to the river in search of
something to eat?</p>

<p>When the meals were prepared, they were
not neatly served as yours are, but each person
took his portion and sat on the ground while
he ate it.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Indians at Dinner.</span>
</div>

<p>All of this seems very strange to you, I know.
If you live in the city, you are accustomed to
seeing the butcher, the baker, the milkman, and
the grocer call every day. There are stores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
where people can buy whatever they want to
eat, drink, or wear. You wonder how any one
could live in such a way as I have described,
but there <i>are</i> people who live in this fashion
to-day, although you have never seen any of
them. They are <i>uncivilized</i>. Where do you
think they are to be found? When people live
in this way, it takes most of their time to provide
themselves with the things that are necessary to
life. They have little opportunity to improve
their ways of living and of thinking.</p>

<p>Civilized people divide their work. Some
provide food, some make clothing, some build
houses, and some furnish fuel. Each one does
his or her part. In this way, you see, they learn
to do their work better and better, because each
gives much time and thought to one kind of
work. This plan gives each one time to study
and to learn something about the world and its
people. Think how much better our homes, our
clothing, and our food are, than are those of
uncivilized people, and how many other advantages
we have.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;White People at Dinner.</span>
</div>

<p>It is only possible to live as we do, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
each one works for others as well as for himself.
If any one fails to do his part, the rest
must suffer until some one is found to take his
place. It is to prepare yourself to do <i>your part</i>
in some useful work for others, that you are
going to school day by day. You do not now
know just what that work is to be, but I want
you to remember that <i>all</i> honest work is noble.
It is not so important <i>what work</i> you do, as it is
that you should do your work <i>well</i>. No matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
what your work may be, you can carry sunshine
in your face and helpfulness in your heart. If
you do this, you will be known and loved.
Hard work, coarse clothes, and lack of money
can never hide these things, neither will the
finest of clothing cover a selfish or untruthful
nature.</p>

<p>Let us look at this dinner table loaded with
good things to eat and drink. There are bread,
butter, meat, vegetables, milk, tea, fruits, and
other things. You see at once that many persons
must have worked to provide this food, for
only a small part of the work was done in the
kitchen. If these things could but speak, they
might tell you stories as wonderful as fairy
tales. They have been gathered here from the
fertile plains of the West, from the sunny
South, from Brazil, from the islands of the
Pacific Ocean, from far-off China, and even
from the waters of the sea.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF A LOAF OF BREAD</h2>


<p>In the dark granary of a farmer's barn in
North Dakota once lived a modest family of
grains of wheat. The bright, warm days of the
summer time, during which they had been
placed in this dark room, soon grew shorter
and cooler. The swallows, whose mud nests
were in the rafters overhead, told the wheat
brothers that winter was coming, and then flew
away to the balmy southland.</p>

<p>Soon biting winds and blinding snow came
sweeping over the level land. Sometimes the
farmhouse was almost hidden under the drifts,
and the farmer had to shovel out a path to the
barn, so that he could feed the horses and cattle.
By and by the days grew warmer, the snow disappeared,
and the birds returned one by one.
The farmer and his men got out their plows
and harrows, and prepared the soil for the
seeds soon to be planted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>The wheat was now shoveled into sacks and
taken to the fields. Here it was placed in great
machines drawn by horses, which scattered it
evenly over the land and at the same time
covered it with soft soil. The men whistled
and sang as they worked, and blackbirds, bluebirds,
and larks flew back and forth, singing
and searching for bugs and worms, as well as
for the shining kernels of wheat.</p>

<p>The wheat was not content to remain underground,
but kept trying to push itself out into
the world. One night there came a warm
shower, and the next morning what looked
like tiny, green blades of grass appeared all
over the field.</p>

<p>All through the spring and summer the wheat
kept growing, and finally there appeared at the
ends of the stalks clusters of kernels, just like
those which the farmer had planted. Some of
these kernels had produced families of twenty
or thirty. These clusters are called <i>heads</i>.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;Harvesting Wheat in Southern California.</span>
</div>

<p>As the south wind passed over the field it
brought the wheat messages from Minnesota,
Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and other states, telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">&nbsp;</a></span>
of relatives who were already turning golden
in the summer sunshine. One day some of
the kernels thought they heard a voice from
California.    Do you think they did?</p>

<p>The grain in some of the fields was called
<i>winter wheat</i>. This was because the grain had
been sown the autumn before, and had remained
in the ground all winter, covered by a blanket
of snow. Why was it sown in the fall? The
wheat of which I am telling you was called
by the farmer <i>spring wheat</i>.</p>

<p>Soon machines, each drawn by several horses,
appeared. They cut the waving grain, and
bound it up in bundles called <i>sheaves</i>. These
were set up in double rows to dry, and afterward
put into another machine which separated
the kernels from the stalks, which were
now called <i>straw</i>. This work the farmer calls
<i>threshing</i>. See if you can find out how this
used to be done.</p>

<p>After threshing, the wheat was put into
sacks and taken to the nearest railroad station.
Freight cars then carried it across the level
prairies to the beautiful city of Minneapolis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
built beside the Falls of Saint Anthony. What
river is this city on? Of what use are the
falls?</p>

<p>There are tall buildings called <i>elevators</i> here
in which the wheat was stored for a time.
Before being put into the elevators it was
examined and <i>graded</i>. As there was wheat
from many farms it could not be kept separate,
so each farmer was told how much he had,
and how it graded.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Threshing Wheat in Southern California.</span>
</div>

<p>Some time after this the wheat was taken
to one of the great mills to be ground into
flour. The largest of these mills manufactures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
about fifteen thousand barrels of flour every
day. This is the largest flour mill in the
world.</p>

<p>When the kernels reached the mill, they
were put into machines called <i>separators</i>, to
be separated from all companions such as grass
seed, mustard seed, and wild buckwheat. They
were then placed in an iron box in which
brushes were revolving rapidly, and were
<i>scoured</i> to free them from fuzz and dirt.
Those that were very dirty were washed.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 6.&mdash;The Largest Flour Mill in the World.</span>
</div>

<p>The kernels were <i>steamed</i>, in order that the
coating, called <i>bran</i>, might not break into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
small pieces. This is called <i>tempering</i>. The
kernels now thought that their trials were
over, but they were mistaken. Soon they
found themselves being <i>crushed</i> between rollers.
After they came out they were <i>sifted</i>, and then
run between other rollers. This was repeated
six times, and each time the flour was a little
finer, for the rollers were closer together. The
flour was then run through tubes of flannel.
These took out whatever dust it contained.    It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was then ground still finer. The flour was
then put into sacks or barrels, which were
marked for shipment to other parts of the
country.</p>

<p>Only the wheat intended for the very best
grade of flour is treated as carefully as this was.</p>

<p>What industry does the use of barrels bring in?</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 7.&mdash;Grinding Wheat.</span>
</div>

<p>From the mills the flour was sent to many
parts of the land to supply stores, bakeries,
hotels, and homes. Some of it found its way
to the bakery near your home. The bakers, in
their clean suits of white, weighed the flour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
which they were going to use, and then added
a certain amount of water to it. Some yeast
and salt were added also. This mixture they
called <i>dough</i>. You have seen your mother mix
or <i>knead</i> dough, I am sure. The bakers did
not do the kneading with their hands, but by
means of machinery made for this purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 8.&mdash;Bolting Flour.</span>
</div>

<p>When the dough had been thoroughly
kneaded it was left to <i>rise</i>. It is the yeast
that causes the rising. This makes the bread
light and spongy. It was then cut into loaves
and placed in the oven. The ovens in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
bakery are very much larger than those in
your kitchen stove, for many loaves are baked
at once. When a nice shade of brown appeared
on the loaves, the bakers took them out
of the oven by means of long shovels. Soon
the delivery wagons came and were loaded
with the fresh bread to be delivered to stores
and homes. This loaf was just left at the
door and is still warm.</p>

<p>So, you see, a loaf of bread has quite a history.
I have told you the life story of this
one from the time of its grandparents, who
were raised on the plains of North Dakota.
Would it not be interesting to see each of the
people who have had something to do with its
production, and to make the journey which
the wheat and the flour made? You can do
both in your thoughts.</p>

<h2>HOW OUR MEAT IS SUPPLIED</h2>


<p>Ramon lived in a plain, one-story house, built
in the shade of some cottonwood trees that
fringed each side of a small river in the eastern
part of Colorado. A wide veranda extended
entirely around the house, but there were very
few flowers and no lawn. I am afraid you
would not think it a very pleasant place for a
home.</p>

<p>Not far from the <i>ranch house</i>, as it was called,
were the barn and the <i>corrals</i>. A corral is a
yard with a strong, high fence about it, in
which cattle or horses may be placed. On the
bottom land beside the stream, there was a corn
and an alfalfa patch, besides one containing
some potatoes and garden vegetables.</p>

<p>During most of the year the stream was
quite shallow, and flowed quietly over its bed,
but when heavy rains occurred it rose rapidly,
spreading over much of the bottom land and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
carrying so much clay with it that it was almost
the color of coffee.</p>

<p>Except along the river, not a tree was in
sight from Ramon's home, and it was many
miles to the nearest house. For hundreds of
miles both north and south, there stretched a
vast plain. Little was to be seen but sand,
grass, and sagebrush. I had almost forgotten
the prairie dogs, which scamper across the plain
or sit up straight and motionless on a little
mound of sand beside their burrows. They
watch you closely, not moving unless they
regard you as a dangerous creature, when, quick
as a flash, they disappear.</p>

<p>The rainfall is very slight in this part of the
country, being less than twenty inches a year.
On this account there is little attention paid to
farming, but instead, the settlers own great
herds of cattle as well as many horses. Ramon's
father is one of the <i>cattlemen</i> of Colorado.
He owns more than ten thousand head of cattle,
and some of the cattlemen own twice that
number. Of course such great herds of cattle
must have much land to graze on.    Some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the land is owned by the government and any
one may use it. Everywhere fences are far
apart. These great pastures are called <i>ranges</i>.</p>

<p>Ramon's life is not much like yours. His
home is far from schools, churches, stores, or
railroads. He seldom sees strangers, but he
enjoys long rides on his own pony, <i>Prince</i>.
Sometimes he goes with his father and at other
times he takes a gallop with one of the "cowboys"
who herd the cattle.</p>

<p>The "cowboys" almost live in the saddle.
They are out in all kinds of weather and are
not boys at all, but strong, hardy men. They
wear broad-brimmed hats, and carry long ropes
called lassos or <i>lariats</i>, with which they catch
the cattle.</p>

<p>Where there are so many herds they sometimes
get mixed up. On this account each
cattleman marks or <i>brands</i> his animals. These
brands may be the initial letter of the owner's
name, or they may be in the form of a horseshoe,
a cross, a circle, or a crescent.</p>

<p>Each spring and fall the cowboys gather
the cattle together. This is called "rounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
up" the cattle. They are then counted and
the calves born since the last "round up" are
branded. In the fall, in addition to this work,
animals are selected for the market. Why is
the fall a better time for this than the spring?</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p21.jpg" width="450" height="269" alt="Fig. 9.&mdash;Branding Cattle.&mdash;Point to the Lariats." title="Branding Cattle" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Branding Cattle.&mdash;Point to the Lariats.</span>
</div>

<p>The cowboys, mounted upon their swift,
strong ponies, single out the animals that have
never been branded, and swinging their lassos
over their heads, they throw them with such
skill that the loop settles over the head or about
the leg of the one wanted. As soon as the
rope tightens, the pony braces its forefeet firmly
and the animal is finally thrown to the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
It is then branded with a hot iron and allowed
to go. Ramon used to feel very sorry for them
until his father explained that it hurt them
very little, for only the skin was burned.</p>

<p>Sometimes the cattle selected to be sold, are
not quite fat enough for the market. They are
then taken farther east into the <i>corn belt</i> and
fed for a time.</p>

<p>When they are shipped directly from the
range to the market, they are driven to the
nearest railroad and put into yards beside
the track. They are then made to walk up an
incline with high railings ending at the open
doors of a cattle car. The animals are arranged
so that the first faces one side of the car, the
second the other, and so on. This is done so
that the cattle cannot hook one another, and
also that they may be fed and watered on the
way from a long iron trough which is fastened
to each side of the car.</p>

<p>The great cattle markets of the United States
are Omaha, Kansas City, and Chicago. Find
these cities.</p>

<p>One day when Ramon was about fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
years old, his father told him that he was going
to take a train load of cattle to Chicago and
that he might go with him. It was a happy
time for Ramon, you may be sure, for he was
very anxious to see some of the wonderful
sights his father had told him about.</p>

<p>At last the day when they were to start on
their journey arrived. The afternoon before,
the cowboys had driven the cattle to the railroad
so as to load them early in the morning.
Soon after breakfast Ramon kissed his mother
and his little sister good-by, and he and his
father rode off across the level plain.</p>

<p>Finding the cattle already loaded in the
cars, Ramon and his father were soon seated
in the <i>caboose</i>, rolling over the miles of railroad
which connected them with Chicago.
Whenever the train stopped for a few minutes,
they took a long stick and went from
car to car making the cattle that had lain
down get up, so that they might not be injured
by the others.</p>

<p>When bedtime came, they made their beds
on the benches along each side of the caboose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
which are covered with cushions. As they had
brought blankets with them, they were fairly
comfortable.</p>

<p>Ramon did not sleep very soundly the first
night. The engine shrieked from time to time,
and the car rocked and jolted so that he was
afraid of falling from his bed.</p>

<p>The next day they reached a part of the
country where great cornfields waved in the
breeze. The leaves had already turned brown,
and golden ears of grain peeped out from the
ends of the husks. There were stubble fields,
too, where wheat and oats had been harvested.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p24.jpg" width="450" height="146" alt="Fig. 10.&mdash;Bird&#39;s Eye View of Union Stock Yards, Chicago." title="Union Stock Yards, Chicago" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 10.&mdash;Bird&#39;s Eye View of Union Stock Yards, Chicago.</span>
</div>

<p>The country became more thickly settled as
they went on, and the towns were nearer together.
Streams were more common, and
grass and timber more abundant. The young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
traveler wondered why this was so. Can you
tell?</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the fourth day the
train reached Chicago. After much switching
and backing the cars were run into the Union
Stock Yards, and the cattle were unloaded.</p>

<p>Ramon was thoroughly bewildered by what
he saw and heard. Men were shouting and
cracking whips; others were riding up and down
the alleys that separate the yards; dogs were
barking and turning the animals this way and
that, and gates were swinging back and forth.</p>

<p>The cattle were weighed and examined to
see if they had any disease, and were then
placed in charge of a <i>commission merchant</i> to
be sold. Buyers come to the yards and bargain
with these commission merchants. When
an unusually large number of cattle come in,
the prices are likely to fall; when few arrive,
the prices rise.</p>

<p>When the cattle had been yarded, Ramon's
father said that they would go and have
breakfast. In the afternoon they visited the
"yards," and the slaughter and packing houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
The "yards" cover about a square mile of territory.
They are divided into countless pens or
small yards, containing sheds, feeding racks,
and watering troughs.</p>

<p>Ramon asked how many cattle were unloaded
in these yards daily. His father handed him a
copy of the <i>Chicago Live Stock World</i>, and at
the top of the first column he read that on the
day previous there had been received 18,500
cattle, 35,000 hogs, and 18,000 sheep. He
was told that sometimes the receipts are much
larger than this and sometimes not so large.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 11.&mdash;Dressing Beef.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>They followed the bodies of the cattle from
the slaughterhouses where they are dressed,
into the cooling rooms. These are simply great
refrigerators. Wagons come to the cooling
rooms and haul loads of the meat to butcher
shops, hotels, and depots. Within a few hours
it finds its way to smaller cities and towns in
all directions. A great deal of meat is shipped
even to Europe. Why does not Europe produce
its own meat?</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 12.&mdash;Cooling Beef.</span>
</div>

<p>When the meat has thoroughly hardened in
the cooling rooms, it is sent to the curing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
rooms, where it is cut up and packed. Each
person here does his particular work from
morning until night.</p>

<p>Ramon learned, to his surprise, that every
part of the animal is used. Hair, hide, horns,
hoofs, teeth, bones, and even blood, are made
use of.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 13.&mdash;Splitting Backbone of Hogs.</span>
</div>

<p>Most of the hogs which enter the great meat-packing
cities are raised in the corn belt.</p>

<p>The sheep need much pasturage, and so the
largest flocks are found in the Western and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Southwestern states. A single herder may
take care of several thousand sheep. His
faithful companions and helpers are intelligent
shepherd dogs. After a great flock of sheep
has fed on an area, hardly a green thing is
left. The people in the part of the West
where there is little rainfall, object to the
pasturing of sheep around the head waters of
streams, because when the vegetation is removed
the water runs off too quickly.</p>

<p>In the evening our friends watched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
men, women, and children march out of the
"yards." They were told that not less than
thirty-five thousand persons were employed in
the various establishments. There is but one
city in Colorado which contains so many people.</p>

<p>As they sat at breakfast next morning,
Ramon wondered how many of the people of
Chicago were eating steaks from cattle which
he had seen on his father's ranch. The
thought was a new one to him. His trip
had shown him that the cattlemen who lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and worked on those far-away plains were
doing their part in supplying people all over
our country with meat. Their lonely life,
with all of its disadvantages, now had a new
meaning for him, and he went back to his
Western home content with it, yet very glad to
have had this glimpse of another side of life.</p>

<h2>MARKET GARDENING</h2>


<p>Think of the immense quantities of fruits and
vegetables that are used daily on the tables of a
great city such as New York or Chicago. As
we travel up and down the streets of any great
city, we see rows of buildings, sometimes built
in solid blocks and sometimes a little distance
apart. Some have trees and small lawns in
front of them; others are without even this
touch of nature. Nowhere, except in the outskirts,
do we find gardens.</p>

<p><i>These people depend upon others to furnish
them with their vegetable food.</i></p>

<p>Now let us make some excursions into the
region surrounding one of these cities. For
miles and miles we see on every hand <i>truck
farms</i> or <i>market gardens</i>. The main business
of those who live in these districts is to furnish
food for the people of the city, so that the
latter may devote their time to their various
occupations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>We see growing potatoes, cabbages, tomatoes,
beans, peas, squashes, turnips, onions, sweet
corn, celery, melons, and many other things.
Usually all of these will be found in one garden,
but sometimes the farmer raises only a few
kinds, or perhaps but one.</p>

<p>Market gardening is very common in Germany,
Holland, Italy, China, and in other
densely populated countries. Therefore we
often find people who have come from these
countries to America engaged in this business.
Chinese gardeners are seldom seen in the
East, but on the Pacific coast they raise most
of the vegetables used in the cities and
towns.</p>

<p>In the early spring, before the ground is
warm enough to make seeds grow, the gardener
starts his plants in "hotbeds." These are
long wooden boxes, or frames, without bottoms,
covered with glass. They are usually placed
on the south side of some building or high
fence. The glass covers allow the warm sunshine
to enter the "beds" freely, but they
prevent the rapid escape of the heat. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
see now why they are called "hotbeds." They
are like small greenhouses.</p>

<p>A little later in the spring the fields are
thoroughly cultivated and the plants transplanted.
Of course only the vegetables desired
for the early market are started in this way.
What advantage is there in having the vegetables
ready for the market very early in the
season?</p>

<p>Vegetable farming is not easy work, although
it is a pleasure to see things grow day by day
as you care for them, and as nature supplies her
sunshine and her rain. The fields must be cultivated
almost constantly, to keep the soil loose,
as well as to remove the weeds. Much of the
weeding has to be done by hand, which is
tedious work.</p>

<p>We want our vegetables fresh every morning;
and as the truck farms are at some distance from
the city, the farmer must load up his wagon
the night before. Of course much produce is
sent to the cities on trains, but where farmers
live near enough to deliver it themselves, their
crops are more profitable to them. Why?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p35.jpg" width="450" height="335" alt="Fig. 17.&mdash;A Market Scene." title="A Market Scene" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 17.&mdash;A Market Scene.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Everything is put in readiness before dark;
and while others are still in bed, the farmer
mounts his wagon to start toward the sleeping
city. I have often ridden ten or fifteen miles
on such a load before the stars faded away.</p>

<p>It is a novel experience. At first the night
seems strangely still, but soon you are able to
distinguish many voices coming from various
places. The frogs croak from the ponds by the
roadside; crickets and locusts send their shrill
notes from grass and tree; a night owl startles
you by his dismal hoot; the lamps of the fireflies
gleam, then disappear only to shine out
again a little farther on.</p>

<p>At last a faint glow appears in the eastern
sky, which grows brighter and brighter until
the shining face of the sun is pushed above the
horizon. Do you not think such a ride would
be more enjoyable than a street car ride?</p>

<p>In the cities there are market places where
produce from the country is taken. In Chicago
there is a very busy street where much of the
buying and selling is done. Study the picture
carefully. Here the buyers from hotels, restaurants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and stores, as well as the men who wish to
peddle the produce from house to house, go for
their daily supplies. There are also commission
merchants whose stores are on this street.
They sell the produce for those who ship it to
the city by train.</p>

<p>We go to the stores and get what we want
each day, or the peddlers bring it to the door.
You see how necessary it is to have special
workers to supply us with the different kinds
of food. We consider it very important that
we should have vegetables and fruits fresh
daily. The work of supplying us with this
food is very important. Remember that those
who till the soil are entitled to as great respect
as are those who do not work with their hands.
Contact with nature makes men and women
better, and many of the noblest souls that the
world has known have lived in the country and
plowed, planted, and harvested the products
of the soil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<h2>DAIRY PRODUCTS</h2>


<p>Uncle Ben lives on a dairy farm in the western
part of New York State. It is a beautiful
<i>rolling</i> country with cultivated fields, woodland,
and pastures, and here and there a sparkling
stream winding its way through the lowlands.
The farmhouses are large and well built, and
are surrounded by grand old maple, beech, and
elm trees. Most of the barns are painted red
with white trimmings.</p>

<p>There are many dairy farms in the neighborhood.
Some of the farmers send their milk to
the towns to be used directly, some sell it to
creameries, and some to cheese factories.</p>

<p>Last summer I spent my vacation on Uncle
Ben's farm, and Cousin Frank and I had happy
times, you may be sure.</p>

<p>Every day, just before sundown, we went to
the pasture for the cows. There were about
twenty-five of them, and they always seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
perfectly contented after the long day of feasting
on rich grass and clover.</p>

<p>After we drove them into the barnyard Uncle
Ben helped us fasten them in their <i>stanchions</i>
in the barn. Then the men brought the bright
pails and cans to begin milking. Cousin Frank
and I always helped, although he can milk
much faster than I. Some of the cows gave
but two or three quarts, while others gave as
many gallons.</p>

<p>We strained the milk into cans holding eight
gallons each, and put them into tanks of water
to cool. After milking was finished we turned
the cattle into the barnyard for the night.</p>

<p>In the morning we commenced milking about
sunrise. After breakfast the cans were loaded
into a spring wagon and Uncle Ben drove to the
depot. Here they were put on the "milk train,"
which took them to the city.</p>

<p>Many other people sent milk on this same
train. It was sent to bakeries, to hotels and
restaurants, and to milkmen, who delivered it
from house to house. Usually the milkmen put
the milk into pint or quart bottles for people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
who like to have it in that form. Uncle Ben
told us that much of the milk that is sent to
New York City is bottled before it is sent. The
bottling is done by machinery. He also told
us that, because of the great importance of having
pure milk, there are, in all cities, inspectors
who carefully examine the milk and report to
the Board of Health. The cows also are inspected,
and if any are sick, they are usually
killed.</p>

<p>Each evening some one drove to the depot
again to get empty cans which the milk train
had brought home. These were always carefully
washed in hot water before being used
again.</p>

<h2>BUTTER MAKING</h2>


<p>One day, after I had been on the farm about
a week, Uncle Ben took Frank and me to the
<i>creamery</i>. A creamery is a place where the
milk and cream are separated and butter is
made.</p>

<p>We found several wagonloads of milk being
unloaded. The milk was weighed as it was
received, for it is sold by weight.</p>

<p>The milk was then strained into a large galvanized
iron tub, from which a pipe carried it
into a circular machine called the <i>separator</i>.
The separator revolves rapidly, throwing the
milk, which is heavier than the cream, to the
outer edge, where it passes through small holes
into a compartment by itself. The cream rises
along the center and passes through another set
of openings into a special compartment. A pipe
carries it to a large vat, while another pipe
conveys the milk to large tanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Uncle Ben told me that when people make
their own butter, they must wait for the cream
to <i>rise</i> on the milk. The cream is then skimmed
off, and the milk is called <i>skimmed milk</i>. Although
the milk in the creamery is not skimmed,
the same name is used for it.</p>

<p>I asked if the skimmed milk was used for
anything. Uncle Ben gave me a cupful of it
to taste. It was very good. He then told me
that the separator takes out only the part
needed in making butter, leaving all of the
sugar. I did not know before that milk contains
sugar.</p>

<p>The farmers take home loads of this milk to
feed it to their hogs. For each hundred pounds
of milk delivered, they get back seventy-five
pounds of skimmed milk, besides the pay for
their cream.</p>

<p>The creamery man told me that he made
from four to six pounds of butter from one
hundred pounds of milk.</p>

<p>The cream remains in the large vat about
twenty-four hours before it is churned. The
churn, as you see by the picture, is a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
barrel made to revolve by machinery. It takes
from thirty-five minutes to one hour to churn.
The man told me that I might look at the book
in which he kept the record of the churning. I
saw that he made from two hundred fifty to
six hundred pounds of butter at a churning.
He said that some churns would produce more
than one thousand pounds at a churning.</p>

<p>Not all of the cream is made into butter.
There is left in the bottom of the churn a liquid
called <i>buttermilk</i>. This is drawn off, and the
butter is washed and <i>worked</i> before being taken
out of the churn. The working is done by means
of paddles in the churn. It continues for six or
eight minutes and squeezes the liquid out of the
butter.</p>

<p>While the butter is being worked, it is salted.
Some of the butter is unsalted, but most of it
is salted. When butter is made in the home,
it must be churned by hand. Only a few pounds
at a time can be made in this way.</p>

<p>When the butter was taken out of the churn,
the men packed it solidly in wooden boxes about
two feet square and four inches deep.   The bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">&nbsp;</a></span>
of each box consisted of strips as wide as a
<i>square</i> of butter. These were held together
by a clamp, and the sides were hooked to the
bottom and to one another. When the butter
is to be cut into squares, these sides are removed
and zinc ones take their places. In these
there are slits running from top to bottom.
Through these slits a wire saw is run, and so
the butter is quickly cut into one or two pound
squares. The butter is then wrapped in fancy
papers upon which the name of the butter or
of the creamery is stamped.</p>

<span class="caption">A Churn.</span>
</div>

<p>Of course some of the butter is packed in
wooden tubs and shipped in that form. This
butter is a little cheaper than that put up in
squares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHEESE</h2>


<p>I was so much pleased with my visit to the
creamery, that Uncle Ben promised to show me
how cheese is made. So one morning just after
breakfast he, Cousin Frank, and I started out.
After a pleasant ride of about five miles we
reached the factory.</p>

<p>The first process here was the same as that
at the creamery. After the milk was weighed
it was run into great zinc-lined vats. There
were four of these in the factory, each of
which held about five thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben explained that the milk must
<i>curdle</i> before cheese can be made. In order to
make it curdle quickly, a little less than a
pound of a substance called <i>rennet</i> was put
into each vat.</p>

<p>A man worked at each vat with a long
wooden rake, stirring the milk constantly. I
saw a glass tube standing in the milk and
asked what it was. Uncle Ben told me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
look at it closely. I saw that it was a thermometer,
and that it registered eighty degrees.
A little while after I looked again, when it
showed a temperature of ninety degrees. The
milk is kept warm, so as to help it to curdle
quickly.</p>

<p>In about an hour I could see the curd
very plainly, but the men kept on stirring and
cutting it. Presently one of them carried a
piece of the curd to a table. He heated a small
iron rod and touched it with the curd. When
he pulled the curd away, little threads were
drawn out to the length of half an inch or
more. This he called the "acid test," which
showed that the curd was in the right condition
to be made into cheese.</p>

<p>Of course only a part of the milk had turned
into curd; the rest was <i>whey</i>, that was drawn
off and run into tanks. Each man who had
delivered one hundred pounds of milk was
given a check for seventy-five pounds of the
whey. It is fed to hogs. About two hours
from the time that the milk was put into the
vats, the whey was drawn off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>One of the men now took a long knife and
cut the curd into oblong cakes. These he frequently
lifted and turned over. After continuing
this for about twenty minutes, the pieces
of curd were put into a small mill, placed on a
board over the vat, and the curd was chopped
into strips from one to six inches long and from
one-half an inch to an inch thick. Salt was scattered
over the mass by one man, while another
pitched it about with a three-pronged wooden
fork. The man told me that he used three
pounds of salt to each thousand pounds of milk.</p>

<p>Next, a piece of cloth was placed on a board
about sixteen inches square. Two circular metal
frames or bands, about six inches high, were
fitted one within the other and placed on the
cloth. The frame was filled with curd, covered
by a cloth, and another set placed on top of it
until there were five. They were then put on
a table directly under a block which was fastened
to a screw. By turning the screw the
block was pressed against the top board, and
so each frame of curd was pressed. I saw the
whey running out as the squeezing went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
The superintendent told us that the curd would
be left in the press until the next day.</p>

<p>We were then taken into the room where the
cheese "ripens." Here we saw large racks reaching
nearly to the ceiling, filled with double rows
of cheeses. The smallest ones weighed but
three pounds, while the largest weighed fifty
pounds. It may take but a few days and it
may take many months to "ripen" a cheese.
It depends upon the flavor wanted. The man
said that in England "strong" cheese is generally
liked, while in our country "mild" cheese
is preferred.</p>

<p>I asked how much cheese five thousand pounds
of milk would make, and was told that it would
make between four and five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>On the way home Uncle Ben told us that
although our country is a great dairy country,
we import certain kinds of cheese from Europe.
He told us how the Swiss people pasture their
cattle on the steep mountain sides, and that in
every little mountain valley cheese is made, some
of which finds its way over the mountains and
across the sea to the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FISHING INDUSTRY</h2>


<p>Have you ever stood by the side of a stream
and watched the fish dart from one shadow of
overhanging rock into another, or swim lazily at
the bottom of some deep pool? How gracefully
they move and turn! How like water jewels
they flash as the sunlight falls upon them!</p>

<p>Most streams and lakes, like the ocean, contain
fish. So we have fresh-water and salt-water
fish. There are a few bodies of water so full of
salt that fish cannot live in them. Do you know
of any such bodies of water?</p>

<p>Most of the fish used as food come from the
ocean. In this, and in most other countries,
there are many men who do nothing but fish, in
order that other people may be supplied with
this sort of food. They do not depend upon
hook and line alone, but use nets also.</p>

<p>Nets are great sacks made of cord, knotted
or woven together in such a way as to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
spaces or <i>meshes</i>. These meshes are not big
enough to allow large fish to escape. Sometimes
the fishermen go out in rowboats some distance
from shore and then throw the net into the
water. Corks or floats keep the upper edge of
the net near the surface, while weights hold the
lower edge on the bottom.    Ropes are fastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to each end, and so it is drawn toward the shore.
How the fishermen wish that they could see to
the bottom of the restless water and know what
their harvest is to be! When the boats have
almost reached the shore, horses are sometimes
driven into the water and hitched to the ropes.
At last the net is dragged out upon the sands
and the uncertainty is past.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p55.jpg" width="450" height="435" alt="Fig. 18.&mdash;Drying Nets." title="Drying Nets" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 18.&mdash;Drying Nets.</span>
</div>

<p>Look! Within the folds of the net is a countless
number of fishes, each jumping, squirming,
wriggling, trying to get back to its ocean
home. They are of many sizes, shapes, and
colors. Those not good for food, together
with the smallest ones, are thrown back into
the water.</p>

<p>Sometimes a net called a "dip-net" is
dropped from a fishing schooner and drawn
about a "school" of fish. I have seen many
barrels of fish brought up at one time in this
way.</p>

<p>The fishermen keep a close watch for the
appearance of these "schools," you may be sure.
Whales and dolphins pursue them, and gulls and
cormorants circle overhead, for they, too, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fishers. Their appearance helps the men to tell
where the "schools" are. There is a great rush
for the fishing grounds when they are sighted.
The white-sailed schooners skim over the waters
almost like a flock of birds.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p57.jpg" width="450" height="347" alt="Fig. 19.&mdash;A Fishing Schooner." title="A Fishing Schooner" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 19.&mdash;A Fishing Schooner.</span>
</div>

<p>Large quantities of fish are caught by a
method called <i>trawl fishing</i>. This may be carried
on miles from the shore. How do you suppose
it is done? To a very long and strong line,
many shorter ones, each with a hook at the end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
are attached. These lines, to which large buoys
are fastened, are left in the water for several
hours, and then fishermen in flat-bottomed boats
called <i>dories</i> row out from the schooner and
examine them.    The lines are then reset and
the fish taken to the schooner to be dressed.
This is a common method of catching codfish,
which is carried on during summer and winter
alike. Storms and fogs are likely to
occur while the men are out in their little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
boats, making their work full of danger as
well as of hardship.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p58.jpg" width="450" height="358" alt="Fig. 20.&mdash;Splitting Codfish." title="Splitting Codfish" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 20.&mdash;Splitting Codfish.</span>
</div>

<p>Many of the fish are packed in ice and sold
fresh, while others are cured on the boats or
on shore. Some of the fishing schooners carry
great quantities of salt when they start out on a
trip. The fish are dressed and packed in this.
Sometimes they are packed in brine, and along
the shores of some countries they are strung on
poles to dry.</p>

<p>Codfish are dried in great quantities along the
New England coast by placing them on frames
made of strips of wood and raised a little above
the wharf, so that the air can circulate freely.
When the skin and bones are removed and the
flesh cut into strips, it is called "shredded"
codfish.</p>

<p>The principal food-fish are the cod, mackerel,
herring, halibut, shad, salmon, sardines, and
whitefish. Whitefish are caught in the Great
Lakes. To this list the lobster may be added,
although it is not a fish.</p>

<p>A common method of catching lobsters is to
sink a box made of lath to the bottom, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
they crawl about on the rocks. A fish head is
placed in the box for bait. The lobsters crawl
in and are likely to remain until the box is
examined.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p60.jpg" width="450" height="318" alt="Fig. 21.&mdash;Drying Codfish." title="Drying Codfish" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 21.&mdash;Drying Codfish.</span>
</div>

<p>Lobster steamers, fitted up with tanks containing
salt water, run from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland
to Boston and New York. Here those
not wanted are placed on cars containing similar
tanks and sent to interior cities. In this way
fresh lobsters are served thousands of miles
from where they were caught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>A lobster that would cost us from twenty-five
to seventy-five cents brings the fisherman not
more than ten cents.</p>

<p>Along our New England coast there are many
towns engaged extensively in fishing. Portland,
Gloucester, Boston, and Provincetown are among
the number. Gloucester is the most important
fishing town in the United States. From it
fishing schooners go as far as Newfoundland,
Greenland, Iceland, and even to the coast of
Ireland. There are also important fisheries on
the Pacific coast, from San Francisco to Alaska.
Here the salmon are taken in great numbers.
They weigh from twenty to one hundred pounds.
The fish are canned and shipped to all parts of
the country. Besides being caught in nets and
traps and on lines many are caught in "fish
wheels." These are fastened to the stern of a
boat and revolve in the water. The fish are
caught in pockets and dropped in the boat as
the wheel brings them up over it.</p>

<p>There are very extensive fisheries along the
shores of the British Isles and on the western
coast of Europe. Fishing is the chief industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in the towns along the coast of Norway. The
air is full of the odor of fish, while drying fish,
nets, and boats are everywhere in sight.</p>

<p>Although the supply of fish in the ocean is
very great, it is diminishing, especially near the
shore. Most countries now pay considerable attention
to the raising of both fresh and salt water
fishes, and they have passed laws regulating
fishing. Eggs are hatched in great <i>hatcheries</i>,
from which the young fish are taken where they
are most needed.</p>

<p>The great ocean is free to all to sail over or
fish in at will. There is a narrow strip along
the shore three miles wide, which belongs to the
country which it borders. The men of other
countries are not allowed to fish there.</p>

<p>The fisherman is a brave and sturdy man.
His life is full of danger. He battles constantly
with the winds and the waves. Fogs may
hide the sharp rocks which seem to wait for a
chance to destroy his little vessel. Sometimes
icebergs or great ocean steamers sink his boat
and he is never seen again.</p>

<p>When storms are raging and night has settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
over sea and land, and angry waves are dashing
themselves into foam against the shore,
the mothers, wives, and children look anxiously
from their cottage windows toward the sea, and
pray that their loved ones may return to them
in safety.</p>

<h2>OYSTER FARMING</h2>


<p>It sounds strange to speak of farming in the
ocean, but there are many and large oyster
farms all along our coast. Some of these farms
are covered by water all of the time and some
are uncovered when the tide is low. Oyster
farms are far more profitable than are those
upon which corn and wheat are raised.</p>

<p>This is a new industry in our country because
civilized people have not lived here very long,
but it is a very old one in some parts of the
world. As long ago as the seventh century a
Roman knight raised oysters for the market,
and it is said that the business made him very
wealthy.</p>

<p>You will understand better about the cultivation
of oysters, if I tell you first how they
live and grow in their natural homes.</p>

<p>Except during the first few days of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
lives, oysters are prisoners. They cannot move
about freely from place to place as fishes and
most animals can, but they are attached to
rocks, to the shells of their dead relatives, and
to other objects. How, then, do you suppose
they get their food? They grow in immense
numbers, and they crowd one another more than
people do in the tenement houses in our great
cities. In fact most of them are soon crowded
out, and they die, leaving room for the rest to
grow upon their empty homes. In this way
the oyster beds spread out.</p>

<p>These oyster beds are not found in very deep
water, but rather along the shore, generally near
the mouth of some river. As I have told you,
they often live where they are uncovered when
the tide goes out. You can see from this that
it is not very difficult to gather oysters, so that,
partly on this account, man has used them for
food for ages.</p>

<p>When the Pilgrim Fathers landed on the
shores of New England, they found that the
Indians used oysters very commonly. All along
the coast were great heaps of the shells. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the very first Thanksgiving dinner given in
America, oysters were served.</p>

<p>Oysters used to be so plentiful on these
natural beds that they were very cheap. In
some places where the winter weather was cold
enough to freeze the water along the shore,
people cut holes in the ice and gathered them
by means of long-handled rakes.</p>

<p>In a single year an oyster will produce more
than a million young ones. Just think of it!
If all of this family grew up, they would fill a
room fourteen feet in each dimension.</p>

<p>These young oysters are <i>very</i> small. They
are called "spat." Most of them are drifted
away by waves and currents, or devoured by
larger sea animals. The few that escape soon
attach themselves to some object, so getting a
chance to begin the battle of life.</p>

<p>If oysters are caught at all times of the year
it does not give them a chance to produce their
young, and this, as well as catching the young
ones themselves, has destroyed many of the
natural beds. In order to keep up the supply
of this food men commenced oyster farming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
You see how our daily needs and desires lead
to the establishment of great industries.</p>

<p>The oyster farmer prepares his farm in
various ways. He places clean oyster shells,
stones, trays, bundles of sticks, and other things
on the bottom, so that the oysters may find
something to which to attach themselves. Then
he places the young oysters or "spat" on these
objects. When trays are used, several are
placed one upon another and bound together
by means of a chain. These trays are taken
up from time to time in order to gather the
oysters that are ready for market.</p>

<p>Stones are sometimes piled on the bottom
and the "spat" are placed in the crevices between
them. Often stakes are planted in a
somewhat circular form. Cords are attached
to the stakes, to which bundles of sticks are
fastened in such a way as to keep them a little
above the bottom. Young oysters attach themselves
to these sticks, which may be drawn up
when the proper time comes.</p>

<p>Shells are used more commonly than other
things. They are taken from the restaurants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and hotels to the farms in boat loads, to be
scattered over the bottom.</p>

<p>The young oysters grow at very different
rates. In two years they may grow to be six
inches in length, or it may take several years to
reach that size. They grow more rapidly on
the artificial beds, and are better in quality also.
The starfish is one of the greatest enemies of
the oyster, large numbers of which it destroys
every year.</p>

<p>During the fishing season the oyster men go
to the beds in their boats and scoop the oysters
up from the bottom. This is called dredging.
The scoops with their loads of oysters are drawn
to the deck of the boat by machinery. Sometimes
the oysters are gathered by means of long
tongs.</p>

<p>As the oysters are usually in clusters, these
have to be broken up. For this purpose a sort
of a hammer known as a <i>culling iron</i> is used.
The oysters are broken apart and sorted. Sometimes
the oyster man makes three grades and
sometimes four.</p>

<p>Oysters are not the only things drawn up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the dredge. Starfish, lobsters, and various
kinds of fishes are gathered in. The starfish
are killed and the rest thrown back.</p>

<p>The oysters are heaped up in great piles on
the deck of the boat. Sacks and barrels are
filled with them, and many car loads are
shipped daily from the cities near the fishing
grounds. Chesapeake Bay is the center of the
oyster industry in our country. Find it. There
are oyster beds, however, all along both the
Atlantic and the Pacific coasts.</p>

<p>Great quantities of oysters are canned near
where they are caught. Getting them out of
their shells is not an easy matter. For this
purpose a knife is used. This work is called in
the South "shucking oysters." Canning oysters
is an important industry in the city of
Baltimore. Have you ever seen cans of oysters
that came from there?</p>

<h2>A RICE FIELD</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>


<p>When you do not feel quite satisfied with
your breakfast, dinner, or supper, and think
that there should be a greater variety of food
on the table, just come with me and we will
visit some of the boys and girls of far-away
China. What do you suppose <i>their</i> chief article
of food is? Rice. Rice in the morning, rice
at noon, and rice at night. Rice from the
beginning to the end of the year. In the
poorer families a bit of dried fish and some
vegetables are usually eaten with it. Those
who can afford such things have bits of preserved
ginger, mushrooms, and barley cakes
with the rice. Of course the rich people have
other things to eat, but most of the people of
China are poor.</p>

<p>In the fertile portions of China the people
live very close together. Gardens take the
place of farms. Workmen often receive no
more than ten cents a day.    On this account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
they cannot afford the variety of food that we
have, but must be content with whatever is
cheap and nourishing for their labor. If the
rice crop were to fail, the Chinese would suffer.
You will see how important this food is to
them, when I tell you that they are forbidden
by law to sell rice to other countries.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are wondering where the rice
that we use in this country comes from.    Rice
is grown in great quantities in Japan, Corea,
Indo-China, Ceylon, India, the Philippines, the
Hawaiian Islands, and in our Gulf states.</p>

<p>Rice is the chief food of one half the people
of the world. Although we raise large quantities,
we produce only about one half of what
we use. It is a kind of grain which will not
thrive on the fertile Western prairies where corn,
oats, and wheat grow. It needs a warm climate
and a great deal of water. For this reason the
rice fields are found on the marshy lands near
the coast, and by the banks of rivers, where they
can be easily flooded. Some rice is raised on
the uplands, but not so successfully as on the
lowlands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Canals are dug from the streams through the
farms, and from these smaller ditches branch
off so as to reach all parts. They are so
arranged that the farmer can turn the water
on or off whenever he wishes. On some of
the farms, wells   furnish   the   water   to   the
canals.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p72.jpg" width="450" height="321" alt="Fig. 22.&mdash;A Rice Field.&mdash;Observe the Canal." title="A Rice Field." />
<span class="caption">Fig. 22.&mdash;A Rice Field.&mdash;Observe the Canal.</span>
</div>

<p>In the Gulf states the fields are plowed in
the winter, and the rice is sown between the
first of April and the middle of May. Sometimes
the seed is sown broadcast, as wheat is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and sometimes it is planted in regular drills or
trenches about twelve inches apart.</p>

<p>The Japanese sow the seed in gardens, and
when the plants are eight or ten inches high,
they are pulled up and transplanted to the
fields. The men work right in the water, for
the fields are flooded at the time.</p>

<p>In our country the farmer floods the field as
soon as the seeds are planted, allowing the
water to remain five or six days. When the
young blade of rice is a few inches high, the field
is again flooded. After the second leaf appears
on the stalk, the water is turned on and left
for twenty or thirty days. After the land dries
the crop is hoed. The fields are irrigated from
time to time, until about eight days before the
harvest, which generally occurs in August.</p>

<p>When full grown, the stalks are from one to
six feet in height, with long, slender leaves.
The kernels grow much as those of wheat and
oats do.</p>

<p>On account of the fields being so wet, rice,
in most countries, is cut by hand. In China
and Japan small curved sickles are used, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the grain is bound up in very small bundles.
In Louisiana and some other parts of the
South, regular harvesters are used. They have
very broad wheels. Why?</p>

<p>After the grain has been bound into bundles,
these are set up in double rows to dry. This
is called <i>shocking</i> the rice.    The grain is then
put through a thrashing machine, to separate it
from the straw.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p74.jpg" width="450" height="176" alt="Fig. 23.&mdash;Harvesting Rice." title="Harvesting Rice" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 23.&mdash;Harvesting Rice.</span>
</div>

<p>Rice kernels are covered by a husk. Before
the husk is removed the grain is often called
<i>paddy rice</i>. Removing the hulls or husks is
called <i>hulling</i>. The hulling machine is a long
tube into one end of which the rice is poured.
Within the tube are ribs which revolve rapidly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
As the kernels pass between these the hulls
are taken off.</p>

<p>If you were passing through a Chinese village,
you might hear sounds like those produced
when a man pounds with a mallet on a great
piece of timber. On searching for the sounds,
you would find that they came from the rice
mill. The mill consists of a portion of a log
hollowed out and placed upright. In the hollow
a quantity of rice is held. A piece of
timber, fastened to a pivot, extends in a horizontal
position with one end over the mill. To
this end another timber is fastened in an upright
position. A Chinaman gets on to the end of the
long timber which is farthest from the mill.
This raises the end with the upright. He then
jumps off and the upright falls, striking upon
the rice.    In this way the hulls are worn off.</p>

<p>After hulling, the grain is carefully screened,
in order to remove the hulls, the broken and
very small kernels, and the <i>rice flour</i>. This
latter makes good cattle food.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have noticed that rice kernels
have a bluish appearance.    This is not natural,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
but is the result of polishing. The polishing
removes much of the best part of the grain,
but the rice sells for a higher price simply on
account of its appearance.</p>

<p>The polishing machine is cylindrical or drum-like
in shape. Moosehide or sheepskin is
tacked to the cylinder. It is made to revolve
rapidly, so that the kernels are polished as they
pass over the skin. After being polished the
kernels are run through screens and sorted.
The rice is then put up in barrels or sacks and
shipped.</p>

<h2>HOW SUGAR IS MADE</h2>


<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p77.jpg" width="450" height="276" alt="Fig. 24.&mdash;Sowing Sugar Seed." title="Sowing Sugar Seed" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 24.&mdash;Sowing Sugar Seed.</span>
</div>

<p>This picture represents one of the beginnings
of the great industry of sugar making. The
small objects which you see in the trenches
are pieces of sugar cane.    These "cuttings," as
they are called, are covered with soil. They
soon sprout, and from them grow the tall, waving
fields of cane, which resemble cornfields.
The canes are taller than cornstalks, however.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
How high do you think those shown in the
picture are?</p>

<p>In about ten months after planting the cane is
ready to cut. In the Southern states this work
usually begins about the middle of October.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p78.jpg" width="450" height="284" alt="Fig. 25.&mdash;Cutting Sugar Cane." title="Cutting Sugar Cane" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 25.&mdash;Cutting Sugar Cane.</span>
</div>

<p>The canes are jointed, as cornstalks are, and
the spongy substance between the joints is filled
with a sweet juice. It is from this juice or
sap that cane sugar is made. I have seen
children chew pieces of the cane, and enjoy it
as you do candy; for this use it is sometimes
sold in stores in the South.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill-p79.jpg" width="500" height="279" alt="Fig. 26.&mdash;Loading Cars with Sugar Cane." title="Loading Cars with Sugar Cane" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 26.&mdash;Loading Cars with Sugar Cane.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>After the canes are cut they are hauled to the
mill or sugarhouse on wagons. On the large
plantations <i>tram cars</i> sometimes run right into
the fields.</p>

<p>At the mill the canes are run between heavy
rollers, which squeeze out the sap. Sometimes
as many as seventy-five pounds of sap are obtained
from one hundred pounds of cane. The
crushed stalks are used in the mill for fuel, and
the ashes are returned to the land to fertilize it.</p>

<p>When the juice is first pressed out, it is not
at all clear in color. It is then placed in great
vats or kettles and heated. This heating
causes the water which is in the sap to evaporate,
and it also brings some of the impurities
to the top, where they are skimmed off. When
the evaporating has been finished, there are two
products, molasses and brown sugar.</p>

<p>The sugar must next be refined. For this
purpose it is usually sent to cities outside of
the sugar belt. There are great refineries in
New Orleans, San Francisco, St. Louis, Chicago,
and other cities.</p>

<p>When the <i>raw sugar</i>, as it is called, reaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the refinery, which is generally a tall building,
it is taken to the top story and dissolved in hot
water. It then passes through bags which act
as <i>filters</i>, and through a great cylinder which
contains burned bones, known as <i>bone-black</i>.
You remember that I told you that the bones
of the cattle were saved. This is one of the
uses to which they are put. When the liquid
comes out of this bone filter it is a perfectly
clear sirup, which is then crystallized.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p82.jpg" width="450" height="344" alt="Fig. 27.&mdash;A Sugar Mill." title="A Sugar Mill" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 27.&mdash;A Sugar Mill.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>You know that we buy refined sugar in three
forms: granulated sugar, loaf sugar, and pulverized
sugar. When granulated sugar is
wanted, the crystals are placed in a great
drum, which revolves until they are thoroughly
dried in the right form. To make loaf sugar,
the crystals are pressed into molds, then dried,
and cut into the size desired. In powdered
sugar they are simply ground to a powdered
condition.</p>

<p>Think how much labor is required to produce
sugar, and yet you can buy it for five cents a
pound.</p>

<p>There are great fields of sugar cane in the
Gulf states, in Cuba, in the Hawaiian Islands,
in the East Indies, in India, and in other warm,
moist parts of the world. We buy a great deal
of sugar from Cuba, and from the Hawaiian
Islands. To what city do you think the sugar
from the Hawaiian Islands is sent?</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<h2>BEET SUGAR</h2>


<p>Although the cane fields of the moist, hot
countries yield great quantities of sugar, there
are other sources from which this useful product
comes. In the year 1747 a German scientist
discovered that sugar can be made from beets,
and now about two thirds of our supply come
from these plants.</p>

<p>The sugar beet is not just like the plant of
the same name which we raise for table use.
It is white, and sometimes weighs as much as
ten or fifteen pounds. Beets do not need so
much water nor so much heat as sugar cane,
so they can be raised in Germany, France,
Austria, Russia, and other countries, as well
as in California, Utah, and Nebraska, in our
own land.</p>

<p>In some parts of California there are fields
of beets stretching for miles. The seeds are
planted in rows, which, after the plants have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
come up, are thinned. In four or five months
from the time the seeds are planted, the beets
are ready to harvest.</p>

<p>On most of the large <i>ranches</i> the beets are
dug by machinery. Men then move back and
forth in the fields, cutting off the leaves and a
little of the upper part of the beet, for this contains
too much mineral matter to be of value in
making sugar. The workmen use large knives,
and they walk on their knees.</p>

<p>The beets are now taken to the factory in
wagons, or, if it is far away, they are sent
on trains. When the loads of beets reach the
factory, they are weighed. The teamsters then
drive up an inclined plane to a plank roadway.
There are generally several of these. On each
side of the road or platform are deep V-shaped
trenches with wooden sides, in which streams
of water run. When the wagon has reached
the right spot, the platform upon which it rests
is raised in a slanting position, and the beets
fall into the trench.</p>

<p>A basket full of beets is taken from each
load and tested, to see how much sugar they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
contain, for this determines the price to be
paid.</p>

<p>The stream of water in the trench carries the
beets along, just as they would be carried in a
brook. This, you see, is a quick and easy way
of washing them.</p>

<p>The streams of water carry the beets into the
factory, where they are cut up into strips by
machinery. The juice is then washed out in
vats containing warm water, and is boiled down
in great tanks. The raw sugar is refined much
as the cane sugar is. After the sugar has been
dried, it is run through spouts into sacks held
open to catch it as it comes out. One hundred
pounds are put into each sack. One workman
sews the sacks up and another wheels them to
the wareroom. Train loads are carried away to
be distributed in the parts of our country that
do not produce sugar.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<h2>MAPLE SUGAR</h2>


<p>You would enjoy helping to make some
maple sugar, I am sure, so let us make a trip
to the woods of Vermont or New York, where
maple sugar is made from
the sap of the sugar-maple
tree.</p>

<p>You will need your cap
and mittens, as the sugar
season is the early spring,
when there is yet snow on
the ground. Besides, some
of the work is done at night,
and you will not wish to
miss that.</p>

<p>The owner of the "sugar
bush" bores holes into the trees a short distance
from the ground, into which he slips small
spouts, called "spiles."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 160px;">
<img src="images/ill-p87.jpg" width="160" height="300" alt="Fig. 28.&mdash;Tapping a Tree." title="Tapping a Tree." />
<span class="caption">Fig. 28.&mdash;Tapping a Tree.</span>
</div>

<p>This is called <i>tapping</i> the trees. Underneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the spout a pail is placed. During the day the
sap trickles out and runs into the pail. During
the colder hours of the night the sap flows
slowly, if at all. Sometimes it is so cold that
little sap runs for two or three days at a time.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p88.jpg" width="450" height="287" alt="Fig. 29.&mdash;Oxen hauling Sap." title="Oxen hauling Sap" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 29.&mdash;Oxen hauling Sap.</span>
</div>

<p>The sap is collected in barrels and drawn on
sleds to the camp or place where it is to be
boiled down. This is done in great pans called
<i>evaporators</i>, which may be five or six feet wide,
and fifteen feet long. They are divided into
sections, and these are connected by means of
little openings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>The sap flows into one end of the evaporator and
follows a zigzag path through the different sections.
By flowing slowly over so large a surface,
evaporation goes on rapidly and the sap is changed
to sirup by the time it has finished its journey.</p>

<p>The sirup is put up in cans, or boiled down
into sugar, which is molded into small cakes,
and brings a high price.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p89.jpg" width="450" height="292" alt="Fig. 30.&mdash;Sap-yoke and Pails for gathering Sap." title="Sap-yoke and Pails for gathering Sap" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 30.&mdash;Sap-yoke and Pails for gathering Sap.</span>
</div>

<p>"Sugaring off," as the boiling down of the
sap is called, is quite an event. Often a number
of people will be invited to go to the sugarhouse
and take part in the operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Before the modern evaporator came into use
"sugaring off" always occurred at night. This
was necessary, because during the day the sap
buckets had to be attended to. The young people
would sing songs, tell stories, and eat sugar.</p>

<p>Some of the "sugar bushes" contain but a
few trees and some contain one or two thousand
or even more. A tree will yield from one to six
pounds of sugar during a season.</p>

<p>Our country produces great quantities of
sugar every year, but we use so much that we
have to buy much more than we manufacture at
home. It was not always in such common use,
however, because people in olden times did not
understand how to make it cheaply.</p>

<p>Long, long ago sugar was used only as a
medicine. Don't you wish that all medicine
to-day was as good as sugar? About seven
hundred years ago an Italian nobleman died and
left to his relatives, among other things, <i>six
pounds of sugar</i>. His will caused considerable
comment among the people, who said that no
one family should be allowed to have so much
sugar in its possession.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<h2>WHERE SALT COMES FROM</h2>


<p>The Arab, journeying over the yellow sands,
riding upon the back of his faithful "ship of
the desert," often looks longingly for some
sign of water to cool his parched lips. The
sailor may ride upon the beautiful blue waters
of the ocean in his white-winged ship; but
although there is nothing but water to greet
his eyes, he cannot drink it, for it is bitter
to the taste.</p>

<p>If you were to place a quantity of ocean
water over a fire and evaporate it, there would
remain a white substance. This is common
salt. You see that it is as necessary to provide
fresh water when one wishes to cross the
ocean, as it is if one is going to cross the
desert.</p>

<p>Most streams and lakes contain <i>fresh</i> water,
so you will wonder why the waters of the
ocean are briny. The rocks and soil of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
earth contain salt, and the streams wash it
from the land. Each one carries so little that
we do not notice it, but they have worked so
steadily and so long, that they have carried a
great amount to the sea. None of it can escape,
so the ocean gets more and more briny.</p>

<p>No healthy person would ever think of eating
salt alone as a food, and yet our food
would taste very unsatisfactory without it.
Farmers supply their cattle and horses with
salt, and wild animals search for it in the
forests, and lick it from the soil with their
tongues.</p>

<p>Salt is so important to us that I want to
tell you about some of the ways in which
men obtain it.</p>

<p>Sometimes sea water is placed in great vats
and evaporated. This leaves the salt, which
is then refined. You know that the sun's heat
causes the waters of a shallow pond to evaporate
during warm weather. Shallow basins are
often scooped out along the coast, and the
waters which fill them are then shut off from
the larger body. In time the water evaporates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and the salt, which has formed in thin
layers, is collected.</p>

<p>I said that most lakes are fresh-water
bodies. There are some, however, that are
<i>very</i> salty. Great Salt Lake is one of these.
Streams flow into it, but none flows out. If
you were to bathe in the waters of this lake,
you would find that your body would not
sink.</p>

<p>I have seen great piles of glistening salt
along the shore of Great Salt Lake which
had been obtained by evaporation. A railroad
runs beside the lake, and the salt is loaded
upon the cars to be hauled away. When the
people first settled in Utah, they used to drive
to the lake in wagons to get a supply of salt.</p>

<p>Although the ocean and a few lakes contain
immense quantities of this useful article, we
get most of our supply from other sources.</p>

<p>In the western part of New York State, at
some distance below the surface of the earth,
there is a thick layer of salt. Wells are drilled
down to this; water is pumped into them, and
then pumped out again as brine. This brine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
is evaporated in large pans made of iron, two
quarts of brine yielding about a pound of salt.</p>

<p>In China salt has been obtained in this way
for hundreds and even thousands of years.
Though they had little machinery to work
with in those days, yet by patient, steady
effort, they drilled wells two thousand and even
three thousand feet in depth. From twenty-five
to forty years were required to drill some of
these wells. Those who commenced them knew
that they were not likely to enjoy the fruits
of their labor and that others must get the
benefit of what they did. What does this
show about these people? What benefits are
you receiving from what others have done?</p>

<p>Salt is also mined as coal and iron are.
This is called <i>rock salt</i>. It is obtained in
Germany, Poland, Austria, India, the United
States, and in many other countries.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting salt fields of
the world is in the southeastern part of California.
It is on the Colorado Desert, near the
Colorado River. This was once a part of the
ocean floor and the rocks contain much salt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Water seeping through the earth dissolves the
salt and brings it to the surface at this place.
What happens to the water?</p>

</div>

<p>This salt field covers an area of about one
thousand acres, to a depth of from one to eight
inches. You can see by the picture that it looks
more like a field of snow and ice than one of
salt. The bright sunlight is reflected from its
surface with such power that it hurts one's eyes.</p>

<p>A great plow drawn by a steam engine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
moves over this dazzling field, and throws the
salt up in furrows. It is then piled up, loaded
on to cars, and taken to sheds, where it is purified.
Indians and Japanese do most of the work.</p>

<p>In order to purify the brines they are boiled
in iron pans and treated in various ways to
make them fit for table use. When evaporation
is rapid, the salt crystals are quite small,
but slower evaporation produces larger ones.
Rock salt is dissolved in water and then evaporated.
To get the finest of salt, the crystals
must be ground. When salt is to be used for
other purposes than to season food, not so much
pains are taken. Name other uses of salt.</p>

<p>In olden times, when salt was not so easily
obtained as it is to-day, it was regarded in some
countries as a luxury. This seems strange, does
it not? At one time the Chinese made it into
little cakes, stamped the image of the emperor
upon it, and used it as money. In Arabia those
who together ate food which had been salted,
believed that this established a special bond of
friendship between them. This led to the old
saying, "There is salt between us."</p>

<h2>MACARONI AND VERMICELLI</h2>


<p>Have you ever wondered as you have looked
at the hollow sticks of macaroni in the stores or
as you have eaten them at the table, how they
were made in that way, and what they were
made of?</p>

<p>In Italy macaroni is a very important article
of food, and its use is rapidly increasing in our
own country. For a long time it was not made
outside of Italy, where the city of Genoa was
the center of the industry. Locate this city.
Do you know what great man was born there?
Now macaroni and vermicelli are made in other
countries. There are a few factories in the
United States, but most of what we use still
comes from Italy.</p>

<p>In making these foods only the best hard
wheat is used.</p>

<p>After grinding the wheat, the bran is taken
out and the flour is placed in a large wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
tub. Water is added, and the two are mixed by
hand for a few minutes. In this tub a marble
wheel about five feet in diameter and eighteen
inches in thickness is fastened in an upright
position. This wheel weighs about a ton.</p>

<p>After the flour and water have been mixed,
the wheel is set in motion by machinery, and it
slowly circles around in the tub, pressing the
dough under it.</p>

<p>A man keeps walking in front of the wheel,
moving the dough from the edges of the tub
and placing it directly in the path of it. This
work of pressing the flour into a paste continues
for a little more than half an hour.</p>

<p>The wheel is then stopped and the paste,
which is quite stiff, is cut into cakes about a
foot square and from one to three inches in
thickness.</p>

<p>These are put into an iron cylinder heated
by steam. In the bottom of the cylinder is a
copper plate filled with holes having the centers
filled. A cover fitted to a great screw which
turns by machinery is placed on top. This
slowly, but steadily, presses the paste downward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
It is thus forced through these openings, and of
course comes out in the form of round, hollow
pipes.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p101.jpg" width="450" height="282" alt="Fig. 33.&mdash;Drying Macaroni in Italy." title="Drying Macaroni in Italy" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 33.&mdash;Drying Macaroni in Italy.</span>
</div>

<p>As these pipes issue from the cylinder, they
are straightened out on a wooden tray or platform,
and with a large, sharp knife cut into
lengths of about three feet. They are then
taken to a drying room and spread on wire
frames covered with oiled paper. Here they
are left for about five days, after which they are
placed in boxes and are ready to ship.</p>

<p>The only difference between macaroni and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
vermicelli is that the pipes of vermicelli are
very small and are not hollow.</p>

<p>When vermicelli is wanted, two plates are
placed on the bottom of the press. The under
one is of iron and contains holes about one inch
in diameter. The upper one is of copper and
contains <i>groups</i> of very small openings. There
are sometimes eighty of these openings in a
group. When the plates are screwed together,
the groups of small holes are directly above the
larger openings.</p>

<p>As the paste is pressed, it passes through the
little holes and then issues from the larger ones;
this keeps each little group of pipes somewhat
apart from the others.</p>

<p>Saffron is added to the paste to color it, and
the great golden mass is quite a pretty sight as
it steadily lengthens.</p>

<p>The workman cuts off six or seven feet of it
at a time; and holding it above his head with
one hand, he shakes it out with the other, as one
might shake the folds of a piece of silk. The
pipes tangle up very little. They are cut into
lengths of about eighteen inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>It is then taken to the drying room and
spread out on the trays just as the macaroni is.
A handful of the vermicelli is taken at a time,
and by a peculiar twist of the arm it is placed
on the paper in a form something like that of
the letter <i>n</i>. After drying for five days it is
packed and shipped.</p>

<h2>ON A COFFEE PLANTATION</h2>


<p>Juan and Lupe live in a beautiful valley
where palm and banana trees wave their broad
leaves in the breeze. It is never cold there, so
that many kinds of plants and flowers grow
out of doors which we do not see in our country
except in greenhouses. On clear days they can
see lofty mountains far to the westward, which
sometimes wear caps of white.</p>

<p>Juan is fourteen years old and Lupe is
twelve. Their skin is much darker than yours,
and they have bright black eyes and black hair.
Their father owns a great coffee plantation in
Brazil, not far from the city of Rio Janeiro.</p>

<p>There are many men, women, and children
employed on the plantation, and Juan and Lupe
enjoy roaming about from place to place and
watching them at their work.</p>

<p>In the nursery they see men planting the
coffee seeds in the rich soil. There are some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
plants that have just come up, and some that
are ready to transplant. They are set out in
rows, six or eight feet apart each way, and
sometimes more.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p105.jpg" width="450" height="332" alt="Fig. 34.&mdash;A Coffee Nursery." title="A Coffee Nursery" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 34.&mdash;A Coffee Nursery.</span>
</div>

<p>The trees would grow much taller than those
you see in the picture, if they were not kept
pruned. Do you know why they are prevented
from growing tall? Whenever you look at a
coffee plantation, you see the dark green foliage
of the tree, which is an evergreen. Lupe is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
very fond of the blossoms. They are clear
white and very fragrant.</p>

<p>A tree will yield a small amount the second
year after planting, but it will not produce a
full crop for five or more years. Two pounds
is a good average crop for a tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p106.jpg" width="450" height="336" alt="Fig. 35.&mdash;Picking Coffee." title="Picking Coffee" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 35.&mdash;Picking Coffee.</span>
</div>

<p>The children like to watch the pickers as
they go from tree to tree. Many of them are
about their own age. Some carry a sack slung
over the shoulders, and others carry baskets or
pails. The <i>berries</i> must be picked by hand, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
they do not all ripen at once. They are dark
scarlet in color and look a little like cranberries.
A good picker gathers about three bushels in a
day. The pickers are given a check every time
they fill a basket. Sometimes Juan tends to
this work, and he enjoys it very much. At the
end of each week the pickers are paid according
to the number of checks they have.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p107.jpg" width="450" height="359" alt="Fig. 36.&mdash;Coffee Berries." title="Coffee Berries" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 36.&mdash;Coffee Berries.</span>
</div>

<p>Within the berry are two kernels or seeds,
with their flat sides together. These are called
"coffee beans." It is these beans from which
the drink is made.</p>

<p>The picking is but a small part of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of preparing coffee for the market. The first
operation is removing the pulp. This used to
be done by tramping on the berries, but now
it is done in a better way.</p>

<p>The berries are thrown into a large tank filled
with water, which carries them through a pipe
to the pulping machine. This machine removes
the pulp and separates the beans.</p>

<p>Next the beans are carried to a second tank,
where they remain for about twenty-four hours,
to wash off a sticky substance which covers the
shell of the bean.</p>

<p>If you have ever put beans or peas into a
basin of water, you have noticed that nearly all
of them sink, while a few float. These latter
are the poor ones. This is the way in which
the good and bad coffee beans are separated.
A pipe carries off the seeds that float on the
surface of the water.</p>

<p>The beans are dried on cement floors upon
which they are spread. This drying takes a
long time. Before sunset each day the coffee
must be carried under shelter, for the dew
injures it. While they are drying, the workmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
stir them. Sometimes artificial heat is used,
but this is expensive. Juan's father has a
watchman whose duty it is to guard the coffee
at night, for it is very valuable.</p>

<p>Each bean is covered by a strong shell, or
hull, which has to be removed. The soaking
has loosened this, and so it comes off easier
than it otherwise would. Juan and Lupe often
watch the wheels of the huller as they turn,
moved by patient oxen.</p>

<p>There are two wheels set upright over a
circular box, into which the coffee is put.
As it passes between the wheels and the bottom
of the box, the hulls are removed.
Underneath the hull is a thin skin, which is
also taken off.</p>

<p>In some countries people want the coffee
dyed or colored. A bluish color is given to it
by coating the wheels of the hulling machine
with lead.</p>

<p>The hulls are separated from the beans in
a winnowing machine, and the coffee is then
sorted. Often this is done by hand. The
beans are spread out on a table, and girls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
boys, and sometimes grown persons, sort it into
several grades.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p110.jpg" width="450" height="340" alt="Fig. 37.&mdash;Sorting and sacking Coffee." title="Sorting and sacking Coffee" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 37.&mdash;Sorting and sacking Coffee.</span>
</div>

<p>Juan's father has this work done by machinery.
The coffee is put into a cylinder, in the
bottom of which there are holes of different
sizes by which it is graded.</p>

<p>The last process is to sack the coffee and
send it by railroad to Rio Janeiro. Of course
it is neither roasted nor ground until it reaches
its destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>We do not produce coffee in our country,
but we are the greatest coffee drinkers in the
world. A large part of our supply comes
from Brazil. Trace the course of the ship
from Rio Janeiro to New York. Juan has
often done this, and his father has promised
to take him with him sometime, when he goes
with a cargo of coffee.</p>

<p>You naturally think that coffee of different
names must come from different countries, or
at least from different trees. This is not
always the case. Several brands may come
from the same tree. The name depends partly
upon the size and the general appearance of the
beans.</p>

<p>Coffee is a native of the far East, but it has
gradually been transplanted to other countries,
until it is now very extensively used. Brazil,
Central America, Mexico, the West Indies, the
Hawaiian Islands, Java, Ceylon, and Arabia
are coffee-raising countries.</p>

<p>In 1551 coffee found its way to the city of
Constantinople; in 1652 it had reached London;
and in 1720 it was planted in the West Indies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
You see it worked its way westward rather
slowly.</p>

<p>Several hundred years ago, coffee was very
expensive, so that only the rich could afford to
use it. Instead of drinking it at home, people
went to "coffeehouses," where it was served.
To these "coffeehouses" men brought whatever
news they had heard and told it to one another.
In this way these places served about the same
purpose that newspapers do now.</p>

<h2>THE TEA GARDENS OF CHINA</h2>


<p>At the bottom of the teapot you will find
some leaves. Spread one of them out carefully.
You can see that it was once long and slender,
a little like willow leaves. It may have grown
in some garden in far-away China, for we get
a great deal of tea from that country.</p>

<p>I have told you how close together the people
live on the fertile plains of eastern China.
There is so little room that many live on boats
on the rivers and in the harbors. On this
account their farms are not so large as ours.</p>

<p>The tea trees in the gardens are about five
or six feet high. If they were allowed to, they
would reach a height of twenty-five feet; but
they are kept trimmed for the same reasons
that the coffee trees are pruned.</p>

<p>The trees are raised from seeds, and are
generally planted on land which slopes toward
the south. What advantage is this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>In about three years after planting, the first
crop of leaves can be gathered. In China they
are usually gathered four times each year, and
the trees continue to yield for twenty-five or
thirty years.</p>

<p>When the leaves are picked, they are full of
sap or juice, and so have to be dried. The
drying is usually done on trays made of bamboo.
While they are drying, they are rubbed and
rolled between the palms of the hands, so that
they may dry more quickly and evenly.</p>

<p>Next the leaves are placed, a few at a time,
in iron pans over a charcoal fire. They are
left in these but a short time, for they are hot.
This process is called "firing." Sometimes
the leaves are "fired" but once, and sometimes
twice.</p>

<p>The tea is then spread out, and broken bits of
stems are removed. Some of the tea growers
place the tea in baskets which are suspended
over slow fires, for drying.</p>

<p>If you were to look into some of the <i>tea-hongs</i>
or houses where tea is cured and packed, you
would find the tea dried in a very curious fashion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">

<p>In one of the rooms you would see several
Chinamen rolling and tossing balls about with
their bare feet. The balls are about the size of
footballs and are partly filled with tea. Although
it looks like play, it is hard work. As the balls
are tossed about, the tea leaves are given their
rounded or twisted appearance. From time to
time the workers stop and tie the bags up more
closely at the neck. This method is used in
making <i>gunpowder tea</i>.</p>

<p>Black and green teas are not different varieties,
but are produced by different methods of
handling.</p>

<p>In the great tea-hongs there are professional
<i>tasters</i>,&mdash;that is, men who do nothing but
sip tea from small cups, so as to grade it and
fix its value. This is considered a very particular
line of work and requires an educated
taste.</p>

<p>The ocean atmosphere has a bad effect on tea,
so that the very finest grades are seldom sent
across the sea. When tea is to be shipped by
water, it is placed in boxes lined with a sort
of sheet lead.   This protects the tea greatly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Most of the tea sent to the United States lands
at San Francisco. Why? How does it get to
other parts of our country?</p>

<p>Great quantities of tea are pressed into the
form of bricks and sent over mountains and
across deserts into Russia.</p>

<p>This is called "brick tea." The Russians
are great tea drinkers, and whenever any one
calls in Russia, tea is served. They call their
teapot a <i>samovar</i>.</p>

<p>Better tea is obtained from Ceylon and India
than from China. In these countries Europeans
have charge of most of the tea farms, and they
have carefully studied the cultivation and handling
of tea.</p>

<p>There is a little tea raised in our own country
in the state of South Carolina. It is very fine
in quality and people are willing to pay a high
price for it. Some of it has been sold for five
dollars a pound.</p>

<p>When tea was first brought into Europe, it was
regarded as a great luxury, just as coffee was.
People paid as much as fifty dollars a pound for
it. It is said that some of the tea raised to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
for the royal family of China, is worth a hundred
dollars a pound.</p>

<p>Many people in this country do not enjoy a
cup of tea unless they have milk and sugar in
it. The Chinese do not use either in their tea.
In Russia it is quite common to draw the tea
through a lump of sugar held between the teeth.</p>

<p>You know that tea parties are very common.
The most celebrated tea party ever held was
called the "Boston Tea Party." See what you
can find out about it.</p>

<h2>A CUP OF COCOA</h2>


<p>On the eighteenth day of June, in the year
1771, this notice appeared in the <i>Essex Gazette</i>
of Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"AMOS TRASK,<br /><br />

At his House a little below the Bell-Tavern in<br /><br />

<span class="smcap">Danvers</span>,</p>

<blockquote><p>Makes and sells Chocolate,
which he will warrant to be good, and takes
Cocoa to grind. Those who may please to
favor him with their Custom may depend
upon being well served, and at a very cheap
Rate."</p></blockquote>

<p>This seems to have been the first notice of the
manufacture and sale of cocoa and chocolate in
our country. What is peculiar about the notice?</p>

<p>In those days the raw product was brought
to Massachusetts by the Gloucester fishermen.
They obtained it in the West Indies in exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
for fish and other things which they
took there.</p>

<p>When the Spanish soldier, Cortez, conquered
Mexico in 1519, he found that the people of
that country were very fond of a drink which
they called "chocolatl." It was served to their
ruler, Montezuma, in a cup of gold. When the
Spaniards went home, they of course introduced
the drink into their own country. For a long
time it was very expensive and was not commonly
used outside of Spain, for the Spaniards
kept the secret of its preparation.</p>

<p>Cocoa and chocolate are products of the seeds
of a tree called the cacao tree. It is a tropical
tree and grows in both the Old and the
New World.</p>

<p>Although the cacao tree grows wild, it is also
cultivated in orchards much like fruit orchards
which you have seen. The trees are seldom
more than twenty feet high, but they are rather
inclined to spread out. They require some
shade, and so other trees are often planted
between the rows to shade them. The trees
begin to bear when five or six years old, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
continue to yield for forty years. There are
generally two chief harvests each year, but the
fruit is ripening all of the time.</p>

<p>The blossoms, which grow in clusters, are
small and pink or yellow in color. They grow
directly from the branches or the trunk of the
tree.</p>

</div>

<p>In about four months after the tree has
blossomed, you will find dark yellow or brown
pods hanging from it. These look a little like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
ripe cucumbers, but they are more pointed at
one end and are grooved or fluted. These pods
are from six inches to a foot or more in length,
with a rather thick, tough rind.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 40.&mdash;Native Cocoa Pickers. Ceylon.<br />
(Permission of <span class="smcap">Walter Baker</span> &amp; Co., Ltd.)</span>
</div>

<p>How do you think the pods are gathered?
They are cut off by men carrying long poles,
sometimes of bamboo, to the ends of which
knives are fastened. Only the ripe pods are
cut off and collected in a heap under the tree.
They are left in these heaps for about twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
hours, when they are cut open and the
seeds are gathered in baskets.</p>

<p>The seeds are called "beans." There are five
rows of them, about the size of almonds, within
the pink pulp of the fruit. When fresh they
are white, but when dried they are brown. If
you taste one, you will find it bitter.</p>

<p>You have often seen on packages of chocolate,
as well as on the cans of breakfast cocoa, the
picture of a young woman carrying some chocolate
upon a tray. It is the picture of a beautiful
girl who once served chocolate in the old
city of Vienna. Her name was Anette Baldauff,
and she married a rich count and "lived
happily ever after." It is said that a painting
of her hangs upon the walls of the great art
gallery in Dresden. Point out the cities I have
mentioned.</p>

<p>The seeds are carried from the orchard to the
sheds, where they are prepared for market. Here
they go through a process of fermentation or
"sweating." For this purpose they are placed
in a covered box, or they may even be covered
with earth. This is called "claying." Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the seeds must be dried. They are spread out
on platforms, raised a little above the ground,
so that the air can circulate underneath. You
notice that the roofs do not cover them just
now, for their only purpose is to keep off the
dew and the rain. They are fastened to frames
which have wheels under them. During the
day they are not used, but at night they are
rolled over the cocoa.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 41.&mdash;Drying Cocoa Seed. Ceylon.<br />

(Permission of <span class="smcap">Walter Baker</span> &amp; Co., Ltd.)</span>
</div>

<p>The cocoa is stirred by workmen using long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
shovels or rakes, so that it may dry quickly and
evenly. Once a day the beans are shoveled into
heaps and the workmen tread upon them with
their bare feet, as you see. This is called
"dancing the cocoa."</p>

<p>After the seeds have dried for about two
weeks they are nearly the color of red bricks.
They are put up for shipment in canvas sacks
holding one hundred and fifty pounds each.
The name of the plantation is usually stamped
upon the outside. Guayaquil exports more
cocoa than any other city. Find it. A great
deal comes from the island of Trinidad, and from
the northern part of South America.</p>

<p>When the "beans" have reached their destination,
they must be cleaned, to rid them of dust
and dirt collected on the way. They are then
placed in a great revolving cylinder and roasted.
You remember that when coffee is roasted it
brings out a pleasant odor called its <i>aroma</i>.
The same is true of cocoa. The roasting also
helps to loosen a shell which surrounds the
seed. The shell is next removed and the
"beans" are then crushed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>The Mexicans used to crush the seeds on a
large stone, hollowed out on top. This they
called a "matate."</p>

<p>The crushing is now   done   by machinery.
The broken bits of the cocoa are called "cocoa
nibs." When the cocoa is ground to a powder,
it is put into strong bags and pressed. This
pressure removes a part of an oily substance
known as "cocoa butter." Remember, then, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
cocoa is the meal or flour made from the crushed
seeds from which some of the oil has been removed.
Chocolate differs from cocoa in that
none of this oil is removed in making it.</p>

<h2>A CRANBERRY BOG</h2>


<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Wareham, Massachusetts</span>, Dec. 10, 1901.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frank</span>: How surprised you will be to
learn that I am now a country boy. We left
Boston early last spring, and came out here to
go into the business of cranberry raising. It
seemed very strange at first to travel along
country roads, or through woods and fields,
instead of upon the cement walks of our city
streets, but we all think the country delightful.</p>

<p>A cranberry farm is a marsh or a bog, so
you will see that the vines need a great deal
of water. There are both wild and cultivated
bogs. Those that are cultivated are provided
with a system of ditches, so that they can be
flooded from time to time. It is a good deal
like irrigation in Southern California, I suppose.
We flood the bogs to prevent the berries from
freezing, as well as to furnish the vines with
water. I will tell you more about that by
and by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>Father wanted a larger bog than the one he
first bought, so, soon after we came, he got
another small piece of marsh land which joins
it on the west, and started vines on it.</p>

<p>You know that willows, rosebushes, grapevines,
and many other plants will grow from
<i>cuttings</i>. It is the same with cranberry vines.
The lower end of each cutting is pressed into
the soil, and it soon begins to grow. They are
set in rows about fourteen inches apart. One
of our neighbors, who was starting a bog at
the same time, cut the vines into pieces an
inch or two long, and scattered them over the
ground. He then harrowed them in. The
vines multiply just as strawberry plants do, by
putting out <i>runners</i>.</p>

<p>They tell us that our new bog will produce
a crop in three years. Do you have to wait
that long for a crop of oranges?</p>

<p>By the middle of June our bog was in full
blossom. The flowers are quite small and their
color is a little like that of the flesh. I read
an interesting thing about them the other day.
It seems that the berries used to be called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
"craneberries," because people thought that the
blossoms, just before they opened fully, "resembled
the neck, head, and bill of a crane."
By dropping the <i>e</i>, we got the present name.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 413px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 45.&mdash;A Cranberry Bog. Showing the Young Vines.</span>
</div>

<p>During our harvest time, which lasted from
the middle of September to the last of October,
we were very busy. We did not commence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
go to school until the berries were picked. You
see, frost may occur and spoil the crop, so that
everybody works as fast as possible until the
harvest is over. Father had about twenty
pickers some of the time, besides our own
family.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p134.jpg" width="450" height="334" alt="Fig. 46.&mdash;Cranberry Pickers at Work. Notice how the Bog is

<span class="caption">Fig. 46.&mdash;Cranberry Pickers at Work. Notice how the Bog is
divided into Rows by Means of Cords.</span>
</div>

<p>When we were ready to begin picking,
father took some twine and stretched it back
and forth across the bog, fastening it to small
stakes. This divided the field into rows. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
picker was given a row, and he was not allowed
to change until it was finished.</p>

<p>At first it seemed great fun to get down on
the ground and strip off the bright berries, but
when one does this day after day it gets pretty
tiresome. It must be easy to pick oranges,
because you can stand up while you work.</p>

<p>Father paid the pickers twelve cents a pail.
It takes about three pailfuls to make a bushel.
I averaged about one dollar and a half each
day. I bought a suit of clothes and all of my
books for the year, and have considerable
money left. Some of the pickers who were
quite small did not earn very much. Do you
recognize Jennie? She worked a part of
every day.</p>

<p>Twice during the picking season there was a
sharp frost, but we saved the crop.</p>

<p>The government sends out a Weather Map
every day. Our teacher gets one, and there is
one tacked up in the post office every morning.
These maps tell what kind of weather to expect,
and father watches them closely. When he
saw that frost was likely to occur, he and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
men opened the gates which hold back the
water, in order to flood the part of the bog
where we had not picked. The vines were
buried nearly two feet beneath the surface of
the water. Father says the water cools so
slowly that its temperature is much above that
of the surface of the ground or the air near it,
so the berries do not get frost-bitten. Soon
after sunrise the water was drawn off, and the
next day the bog was dry enough for the pickers
to work.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>I wonder if the Weather Bureau is of any
use to farmers in California. I know that the
sailors watch for the flags which tell when
storms are coming, that they may not go to
sea if a violent
storm is expected.
Father
says very many
lives and much
property are
saved every year
in this way.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 48.&mdash;Winnowing and Barreling

</div>

<p>I have not told
you what we do
with the cranberries
after they
are picked. Of
course we cannot
help gathering
some leaves and twigs with the berries, and these
must be taken out. For this purpose the berries
are put into a winnowing machine. I will send
you a picture of one. As the man turns the
crank, wooden fans within turn rapidly, blowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
out the leaves, twigs, and dirt. The berries drop
through a screen and run out of a spout into
a barrel, as you see. We then put them into
crates or barrels for sale. Father tells me that
cranberries are shipped from our country to
Europe, because those raised here are much
better than the European berries.</p>

<p>There are great quantities of cranberries
raised in this part of Massachusetts. I have
been reading lately that they are produced in
New Jersey, on Long Island, in Michigan, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Canada, and some other sections.
From what I have read, I guess they
are not raised in Southern California. Wouldn't
it seem strange if you were to eat berries raised
on our bog, three thousand miles away?</p>

<p>Now I want you to tell me about the orange
groves of Southern California, for none of us
have ever seen an orange growing.</p>

<p>I wish you all a very "Merry Christmas"
and a "Happy New Year."</p>

<h2>THE COCOANUT ISLANDS OF THE PACIFIC</h2>


<p>Imagine yourself on a great ocean steamship,
gliding over the blue water of the Pacific Ocean
toward the Samoan Islands. Among the first
things that you will see as you near the shores
of these islands will be tall, slender, graceful
trees, rising without a branch to a height of
thirty to eighty feet. At the top is a sort
of crown, composed of long, drooping leaves.
These beautiful trees lean out over the water
and toss their leaves in the strong and steady
breeze from the ocean. They seem to nod a
friendly greeting to you as you approach, and
to wave a loving farewell to you as you sail
away. These trees are the cocoanut palms.
They grow on all of the tropical islands of
the Pacific Ocean, in the West Indies, and
along the shores of most warm countries, but
never far from the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>When the cocoanut falls into the water, it
is rocked and tossed by the waves and drifted
about by the currents, but it is safe within
its shell, for the salt water cannot penetrate
this. When it finally comes to rest upon some
strange shore, it is ready to give to the world
another cocoanut palm, if the climate is like
that from which it sailed. In this way nature
has helped the trees to become widely distributed.</p>

<p>There are cocoanut plantations as well as
wild groves of the trees. When a plantation is
to be established, the planter selects the ripest
nuts and dries them for several weeks. They
are then planted, and by and by a little
palm springs from the small end of the nut
and the roots from the large end. When the
young trees are from six months to two years
old, they are transplanted in rows thirty or
forty feet apart. They begin to bear nuts in
about five years, but they do not yield a full
crop for fifteen or twenty years. Do you think
that a poor man could afford to go into the
business of cocoanut raising?</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/ill-p141.jpg" width="340" height="450" alt="Fig. 49.&mdash;A Cocoanut Grove." title="A Cocoanut Grove" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 49.&mdash;A Cocoanut Grove.</span>
</div>

<p>As you see in the picture, cocoanuts grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">&nbsp;</a></span>
in clusters. You notice also that they grow
close to the stem instead of at the ends of the
branches. They do not all ripen at once, but
nuts may be picked at almost any time. A
tree will produce from fifty to one hundred
nuts each year. If you were to go into an
apple, a peach, or a cherry orchard, you could
easily pick the ripe fruit. Gathering cocoanuts
is quite a different matter, however. Let us
observe this shiny-skinned Samoan boy and see
how he picks them. He fastens a short piece
of rope in the form of a loop to each foot.
Letting one of the loops catch on a rough
place on the bark of the tree he places the
hollow of his foot against it, clasps the trunk
with his hands, and raises himself a little.
Then the other loop is fastened a little higher
up, and he raises himself again. In this way
he finally reaches the nuts. With a knife he
cuts off the ripe ones, which fall to the ground
and are then piled up. They are then placed
in baskets which are hung from a pole and
carried on the shoulders of two men or are
loaded on to donkeys and taken to the shed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>The ripe cocoanut is a valuable article of
food just as it is picked from the tree. It
contains also a milk which is a nourishing
drink. Most of the cocoanut sent to other
countries, however, is in a form known as <i>copra</i>.</p>

<p>At the shed the hard shell, which covers the
meat, is split open by means of an ax. The
meat is removed with a knife and is then
spread out on mats to dry. This dried cocoanut
is copra.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of these cocoanut islands live
in a much more simple style than we do, and the
cocoanut tree supplies many of the things that
they use daily.</p>

<p>Let us examine the home of a native Samoan.
The frame and posts of the house are made of
the slender trunks of the cocoanut palm, while
the roof is covered with its leaves instead of with
shingles. The cups, bowls, dippers, and many
other household utensils are made of the shells.
If a whole shell is wanted, the "eyes" are
pushed in, the milk is used, and ants are allowed
to eat the meat. These make excellent water
bottles. Baskets, curtains, and twine, are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
from the fiber of the leaves, and the bark is used
for fuel.</p>

<p>From the copra an oil is pressed which is used
in the manufacture of soap. It makes a perfectly
white soap that will float on the water. It is
also used to furnish light, and the people rub it
on their bodies to prevent sunburn. The sap
of the tree is made into sugar, vinegar, and
a liquor.</p>

<p>While in our country the cocoanut is important
chiefly to bakers and confectioners, in these
far-away islands it is the most useful of plants,
and one of the chief articles of food. Would
you not like to visit the cocoanut islands and
learn more of their interesting people?</p>

<h2>A BUNCH OF BANANAS</h2>


<p>Every day, as you walk along the streets you
see great bunches of bananas hanging in front of
fruit and grocery stores. You find them at the
corner fruit stand, and peddlers carry them from
house to house.</p>

<p>Although bananas are so common now and so
cheap that all can afford to eat them, this was not
so when your grandparents were children. In
those days the fruit was regarded as quite a
luxury, for there were few people engaged in
carrying it from its tropical home to the cities of
our country. Now many small but swift ships,
called "fruiters," carry on this business. They
get their cargoes of fruit in the West Indies or
Central America, and within a week after sailing
they are unloading at New Orleans, Baltimore,
New York, or Boston. If the number of
bananas which reach our country each year were
equally distributed, each person would receive
twenty-five.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/ill-p147.jpg" width="295" height="450" alt="Fig. 50.&mdash;A Banana Tree." title="A Banana Tree" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 50.&mdash;A Banana Tree.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>Let us get aboard that wonderful train upon
which all may travel free of cost, which runs
equally well upon land and water. We step off
right in the center of a banana plantation on the
island of Jamaica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>Yes, these are banana trees all about you.
See how long and broad the leaves are and
how gracefully they droop! Some of them are
ten or fifteen feet long; almost as long as the
trees are tall. The trees, you see, are simply
stalks from which the leaves unroll. Here you
can see some just starting out. They are rolls
of bright green, pointing upward, each starting
from the center of the stalk. No, the leaves
were not torn in that way by the pickers. The
wind sometimes whips them into ribbons, for
they are very tender.</p>

<p>These stalks growing from the base of the
main stem are called "suckers" here; in Costa
Rica they are called "bits." You remember
that there are no seeds in bananas. It is
these "suckers" that are planted when a
farmer wants to start a plantation. They are
set out when two or three feet high and within
a year they bear fruit. What did I tell you
about the length of time required for the
cocoanut to bear?</p>

<p>It is but four years since the trees in this
plantation were single "suckers," standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
about fifteen feet apart. Now there are several
stalks grouped about each parent plant,
and the beautiful leaves, touching overhead,
form shaded aisles of green.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p149.jpg" width="450" height="334" alt="Fig. 51.&mdash;A Banana Plantation." title="A Banana Plantation" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 51.&mdash;A Banana Plantation.</span>
</div>

<p>Of course a great number of "suckers" are
not allowed to grow together. Keeping these
cut down is called "cleaning the plantation."</p>

<p>Now let us examine the fruit on this tree
beside us. You see that the great cluster or
bunch is made up of smaller bunches. These
are called "hands," and each banana is spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of as a "finger." Let us count the "hands" in
this bunch. This is an unusually large one,
for it contains thirteen. Nine "hands" make
a <i>full bunch</i>. As you see, there are from ten
to twenty "fingers" in a "hand." Buyers will
seldom take bunches of less than six "hands."</p>

<p>Here come the fruit cutters to help get a
cargo for the "fruiter" we saw at anchor.</p>

<p>Yes, the bananas are green, I know, and
they are always green when gathered. They
will ripen in the storehouses when they reach
the United States.</p>

<p>No, it is not a waste to cut down the stalks,
for they die after bearing their fruit, and the
smaller stalks about them will soon yield.
Some of these stalks, you see, have but one
bunch and some have two or three. How odd
the bunches look with the "fingers" all pointing
upward!</p>

<p>The banana leaves which the men are wrapping
about the bunches are to protect the
fruit. It bruises very easily and great quantities
are lost on this account. They are not
always wrapped, however.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>When the fruit reaches the vessel, it is
carefully inspected; and if not in just the right
condition, it is refused. The bunches which
are accepted, are taken into the hold of the
ship and packed closely together. The planter
receives for these from ten to thirty-five cents
a bunch. Just think of buying eight or nine
dozen of bananas for ten cents!</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p151.jpg" width="450" height="360" alt="Fig. 52.&mdash;Loading a Small Boat with Bananas to be taken to the
&quot;Fruiter&quot; in the Harbor." title="Loading a Small Boat with Bananas" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 52.&mdash;Loading a Small Boat with Bananas to be taken to the
&quot;Fruiter&quot; in the Harbor.</span>
</div>

<p>The men will not stop work until the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
is loaded. It may take twenty-four hours,
and it may take twice that long, for a "fruiter"
will carry from fifteen to twenty thousand
bunches of fruit.</p>

<p>In some parts of Central America, where
there are no harbors, the planters float the
fruit down the streams in canoes. The vessels
anchor at some distance from the shore, and
the bananas are taken out in boats called
<i>dories</i>. They are hoisted up to the deck of
the ship by means of pulleys, and then packed
in the hold. The thousands of bunches which
are bruised in handling are thrown into the sea.</p>

<p>While the northern ports get most of their
supply of bananas from the West Indies, the
Pacific coast states are supplied from Central
America. The "fruiters" unload at New
Orleans into trains, which carry the fruit to
Los Angeles, San Francisco, and other places.
Banana trains also run from New Orleans to
St. Louis, Chicago, and other parts of the
country.</p>

<p>The fruit ships have great pipes or ventilators,
which carry the cool, fresh air from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
sea down into the hold. Sometimes when they
reach port it is so cold that the bananas cannot
be taken out for a few days. Wagons are
loaded with the fruit at the wharves, and it
is taken to warehouses where it gradually turns
yellow.    I am sure you have seen loads of the
green fruit on the streets.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 53.&mdash;A &quot;Fruiter&quot; taking a Cargo of Bananas.</span>
</div>

<p>When the wholesale merchant sells the fruit,
he often incloses each bunch in the rough
material of which gunny sacks are made, and
then puts a light, circular frame, made of strips
of wood, over it.    This, you see, protects the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
bananas. The grocer or fruit man takes hold
of the frame without danger of mashing the
fruit, lifts the bunch, and hangs it upon a hook.
The frame and sacking are then removed.</p>

<p>Bananas grow in the tropical parts of Asia
and Africa and on many of the islands of the
Pacific Ocean. They are also raised in Florida,
and they ripen in sheltered places in Southern
California.</p>

<p>You have seen both yellow and red bananas.
The red ones usually bring the higher price,
but they do not keep well and are not so
extensively raised as the yellow ones.</p>

<p>The banana is an important article of food.
It is much more nourishing than potatoes or
even good, white bread. A flour or meal can
be made from the fruit by drying it and then
grinding.</p>

<h2>HOW DATES GROW</h2>


<p>Three thousand years before the shepherds
followed the star to the manger at Bethlehem,
the beautiful date palm was cultivated beside
the banks of the Euphrates and the Nile rivers.
The date was the bread of the people who
lived in these fertile valleys, and it is an important
article of food in northern Africa,
Arabia, and Persia to-day.</p>

<p>Look at a map of northern Africa, and you
will see that the great Sahara covers a large
part of it. Here and there across the drifting
sands wind caravan routes, traveled by camels
ridden by strangely dressed men. These routes
lead to beautiful garden spots called <i>oases</i>.
Here are wells and springs, with little streams
flowing in the shade of fig, date palm, and
other trees. The people who dwell within
these groves beside the cooling waters look
out upon the desert as the inhabitants of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
island might look upon the boundless sea.
Find some of these oases and learn why they
are fertile. The people who live in these
oases depend upon dates for their living. The
dreary journey from the coast to the interior
is made to procure quantities of this fruit,
which are wanted by the outside world.</p>

<p>If you were to make a journey in a desert
country, you would find that you could not
carry such articles of food as you would have
if you remained at home. The sunshine beats
down fiercely, the springs and wells are far
apart, and the patient animals must not be
overloaded. The chief article of food carried
is the date. A mass is packed together until
it is so hard that pieces are chopped off with
a hatchet when they are wanted.</p>

<p>Like the cocoanut palm, the date palm rises
to a great height, sometimes fifty or sixty feet,
without branches. It ends in a crown of beautiful
feathery leaves which droop downward.
These leaves may be ten or fifteen feet long.
Many of them stand edgewise. Unlike most
trees, the trunk does not steadily increase in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">&nbsp;</a></span>
size, and you can tell nothing as to the age of
the tree by its diameter.</p>

</div>

<p>In its wild state many shoots spring from
the base of the tree. These may grow as high
as the parent stalk, so that in time a jungle or
thicket is formed.</p>

<p>The flowers, which are clear white, grow in
clusters. There are from six to twenty of these
clusters on a tree, each of which produces a
bunch of dates. The female tree bears the
fruit. The blossoms are pollinated both by the
wind and by man.</p>

<p>There are from ten to fifteen pounds of dates
in a bunch. A tree will average from one hundred
to two hundred pounds each year, although
trees have been known to yield six hundred
pounds. The trees yield when from four to
eight years old, and continue to bear for a
century.</p>

<p>The dates, green at first, later in the year a
yellowish brown, are, when ripe, amber or black
in color.</p>

<p>The trees require a very dry, hot climate, but
moist soil.    Long, long ago, this saying was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
common among the Arabs, "The date palm,
the queen of trees, must have her feet in running
water and her head in the burning sky."</p>

<p>Although there are lovely date palm trees on
the grounds of many California homes, few of
them bear fruit. The temperature must average
from eighty to ninety degrees for a considerable
time in the summer, in order to mature
it. What is the average summer temperature
in your locality?</p>

<p>If an ordinary tree is frost-bitten, it recovers
and soon puts out a new growth; but if the
crown of the date palm be frozen, the tree dies.</p>

<p>When the Moors went to Spain, in the
eleventh century, they introduced this valuable
tree which the mission fathers several hundred
years later brought to Mexico and to Southern
California.</p>

<p>How would you like to try to climb a date
palm tree? Although they look so smooth
and are without branches, the natives of the
desert climb them without any help whatever.
The trunk is always somewhat rough, and this
makes it possible to ascend them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Not all of the dates in a bunch ripen at once,
so they are usually picked by hand and only
the ripe ones selected. Sometimes, however, the
bunches are cut off. Some dates contain so
much sap that the bunches must be hung up
to allow it to drain off before they can be
shipped. This sap is called <i>date honey</i>, and is
saved. They are sent to the coast towns in
bags or boxes called <i>frails</i>. Where dates
are to be sold in small quantities, they are
repacked in the small boxes such as you have
seen.</p>

<p>You know that dates are very sweet, and it
is no wonder that they are, for they contain
from fifty-five to sixty per cent of sugar.</p>

<p>The trees are often tapped, and the sap which
flows out is made into sugar. Vinegar and a
liquor called <i>arrack</i> are also made from it.
The leaves of the tree are made into bags and
mats; from the stones a drink is made which
takes the place of coffee. From the leafstalks
baskets are made, while the trunk furnishes
material for houses and for fences.</p>

<p>If the dates could speak, they could tell us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
many wonderful stories of the far East, of the
river boats on the Nile, of the drifting sands
which come so close to the river's banks, of
the caravans creeping over the desert toward
the green oases and then fading out of sight,
bearing loads of this food to the countries
where it is not produced.</p>

<h2>THE ORANGE GROVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</h2>


<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Pasadena, California</span>, Jan. 4, 1902.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend Will</span>: I was very glad to
receive your letter, and much surprised to know
that you are living on a farm. I am glad that
you described the raising of cranberries, for I
did not know much about it before. When I
told my teacher about getting the letter, she
asked me to read it in the geography class
and to show the pictures. I asked our grocery-man
where he gets his cranberries, and found
that some of them came from Wareham.</p>

<p>You are having cold weather now, I know.
Is the skating good? I have not seen ice as
thick as window glass since we came to California,
except that delivered by the iceman.
Just now there is a beautiful covering of snow
on the mountains a few miles north and east
of town.    Just think of picking roses and callas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
with snow in plain sight! The snow never
remains more than a day or two on these
mountains.</p>

<p>Soon after we came to Pasadena, father
bought an orange grove of twenty-five acres.
We are picking the fruit now. People began
to pick oranges several weeks ago, and the
work will continue all winter.</p>

<p>Orange trees are planted about twenty feet
apart, but the groves do not look as apple
orchards do in the East, for no grass is allowed
to grow in them.</p>

<p>The best orange section is east of here, near
Redlands and Riverside, but some good fruit is
raised near Pasadena also.</p>

<p>Father keeps our trees pruned down rather
low, so that it is easier to pick the oranges
than it would be if they were allowed to grow
very tall.</p>

<p>Orange raising is like cranberry growing in
one way&mdash;the land must be irrigated in each
case. Here the water is piped from the mountain
streams and from tunnels. We form
basins about ten feet square around each tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and fill them with water. Most of our irrigating
is done during the summer, as the winter
is our rainy season. <i>You</i> would not call it a
very rainy time. Our average is about twenty
inches for the whole year.</p>

<p>The trees in our grove have been set out
about six years, and they are bearing nicely
now. Orange trees begin to bear when they
are four years old; so, you see, we have to wait
a little longer for a crop than you do for a crop
of cranberries. It costs a good deal to start an
orange grove. Trees cost from one dollar to
one and one-half dollars each at the nurseries.
A few years ago they sold for twenty cents each.</p>

<p>I wish that you could see the trees when
they are in full blossom, and also when they
are loaded with the golden fruit. I am going
to put some orange blossoms into the envelope,
but I am afraid they will not reach you in very
good condition. They are very fragrant, and
you can smell their perfume some distance from
a tree in blossom.</p>

<p>To-day we picked about two hundred and fifty
boxes of oranges. We always speak of <i>picking</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
them, although they are not picked, but cut.
You see, if they were picked off, the part where
the stem pulled off would soon begin to decay.</p>

<p>We take a wagon load of fruit boxes, and,
while father drives slowly between the rows
of trees, I throw them off.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p168.jpg" width="450" height="255" alt="Fig. 56.&mdash;Picking Oranges in California." title="Picking Oranges" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 56.&mdash;Picking Oranges in California.</span>
</div>

<p>Each picker carries a sack slung over one
shoulder, and as fast as he cuts off an orange,
he drops it into the sack. The sacks are
emptied into the boxes, and these are loaded
on to the wagon. Father pays five cents a
box for picking, and a good picker will gather
about forty boxes in a day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<p>We sell most of our oranges to fruit companies.
These companies pack and ship the
fruit. At the packing houses the oranges are
placed in tubs of water and scrubbed with
small brushes. Many women, girls, and boys
work at this. The washing is to take off dirt,
and also <i>scale</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p169.jpg" width="450" height="269" alt="Fig. 57.&mdash;Grading and Packing Oranges." title="Grading and Packing Oranges" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 57.&mdash;Grading and Packing Oranges.</span>
</div>

<p>After the oranges are washed, they are placed
in a sort of trough which is highest at the end
near the tub. They roll down this trough to
the <i>grader</i>. This is a machine so arranged
that the oranges pass through different openings
according to their size, and come out sorted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>In the warehouse close by they are wrapped
and packed. Chinamen often do this work.
Each orange is wrapped in a separate piece of
paper, which has the brand of the company
stamped upon it. It is then packed firmly in
a box. A certain number of oranges of each
grade fill a box, ninety-six of the largest grade,
and about two hundred of the smallest. Those
which are too small, as well as the imperfect
oranges, are rejected. These are called <i>culls</i>.
Sometimes these are sold for a low price, and
sometimes they are thrown away by wagon
loads.</p>

<p>After the boxes are filled, they are placed
in special fruit cars and hurried to St. Louis,
Chicago, New York, Boston, and other cities.</p>

<p>Yes, the Weather Bureau is of great help to
fruit growers. Of course we have very little
winter here, but oranges will not endure much
cold. The mercury falls below the freezing
point but a few times each season. On New
Year's Day the temperature here was fifty-eight
degrees. I looked up the Boston temperature
for the same day and found that it was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
four degrees above zero. When the Bureau
predicts a sharp freeze, the farmers build small
fires in their orchards, or turn on a good deal
of water. The fires are built in small wire
baskets. They make a smudge instead of a
flame. The people in the raisin districts watch
the weather reports pretty closely, for rain
injures the drying grapes.</p>

<p>Growers have to <i>spray</i> or <i>fumigate</i> the trees
to destroy the scale that I spoke of which is a
great enemy of the orange, to kill the insects,
and to wash off dirt. This is sometimes done
by putting a great piece of canvas over the tree,
forming a sort of tent which prevents the fumes
from escaping. It was found that the ladybugs
would eat the scale and so they were brought
into California from the East. They do a great
deal of good, but still we have to spray the
trees.</p>

<p>Orange trees are raised from the seed, and
the trees produced in this way are called <i>seedlings</i>.
By <i>budding</i>, a fruit much better than the
oranges grown on the seedling tree has been
produced. There were five acres of seedlings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in our grove, and father budded the trees. He
cut off the limbs rather close to the trunk of
the tree. Then he slipped buds from <i>navel</i>
trees into cuts made through the bark in the
end of each limb left on the tree. He then
wound cord tightly about the limb and put on
some wax. After a time a new growth started
out where these buds were placed. These new
branches will bear much improved fruit.</p>

<p>We have a very fine variety of oranges called
Washington Navels. Trees of this variety were
obtained by our government from Brazil. Two
of these were brought to Riverside, a town
about seventy-five miles east of Pasadena, and
planted on a ranch belonging to a Mr. Tibbits.
They did well, and all of the trees of this variety
in Southern California were obtained from
these two through budding. These trees are
still living.</p>

<p>California and Florida are the two important
orange-growing states of our country. Father
says the industry is much older in Florida than
in our state. Florida growers can ship their
fruit to market much cheaper than we can. It
costs us ninety cents for each box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>Mexico, the West Indies, Italy, southern
France, and Spain are also orange producers.
These countries have the advantage of cheap
labor, father says.</p>

<p>I wish that you could visit us. We would
have fine times, I am sure.</p>

<p>The next time I write I will tell you about
some of the other fruits raised in California.</p>

<h2>A VISIT TO A VINEYARD</h2>


<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Pasadena, California</span>, Oct. 1, 1902.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear friend Will</span>: Last week father
went to Fresno, which is about three hundred
miles northwest of here, in the San Joaquin
valley. He took me with him, and we visited
some of the great vineyards and raisin-packing
establishments near and in that city.</p>

<p>Raisins are simply dried grapes. Although
there are many countries where grapes grow,
there are few where raisins are made. Dew,
fog, and rain injure the fruit, so that the San
Joaquin valley, with its dry, hot atmosphere, is
well adapted to this industry.</p>

<p>There are a great many different kinds of
grapes but only the green variety is used in
making raisins. The raisin grapes are called
<i>muscats</i>. If the grapes are left on the vines
long enough, they become raisins. I have
picked some pretty good raisins from the vines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Of course by being spread out, they dry quicker
and more evenly.</p>

<p>The sugar that you find on and in the raisins
is not put there by the people who dry the
grapes. It comes from the juice of the grape.</p>

<p>Grapevines grow from both roots and cuttings.
Of course cuttings are the cheaper.
Often they may be had for the asking. Many
think that it is better to set out rooted vines
than cuttings.</p>

<p>They are planted in rows from six feet apart
to twelve or fifteen feet. During the first year
the young vines will grow several feet. In
the fall, when the flow of the sap has been
checked by frost, the vines are pruned. A vineyard
in California looks quite different from one
in the East. During the winter it is simply so
many rows of stumps several inches in thickness
and one or two feet high. During the summer
the branches grow from these stumps and produce
their beautiful clusters of grapes, only to
be cut off in the fall or winter.</p>

<p>The trimmings are generally burned in the
vineyard at the same time that they are cut off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
A sort of furnace made of sheet iron is fastened
between two wheels and drawn by horses up
and down between the rows. A man pitches
the cuttings into it, and they burn as it moves
along.</p>

<p>In the early summer men go through the
vineyards sprinkling a coating of sulphur on
the vines. This is to prevent mildew, which
damages the fruit very much.</p>

<p>During the last half of August and September
the grapes are picked. Sometimes the
harvest continues into October. Most of the
grapes had been gathered when we visited
the vineyards.</p>

<p>When the juice of the grapes is one fourth
sugar, they are ready to pick. The grower
generally tells the condition by the taste and
color of the fruit, although there are instruments
for determining the amount of sugar.</p>

<p>Like oranges, grapes are cut from the vines
and not picked. We saw great companies of
Chinamen going through the vineyards cutting
off the beautiful clusters. These they placed on
shallow, wooden trays to dry. In a week or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">&nbsp;</a></span>
two, when the upper side of the clusters is
pretty well dried, the grapes are turned. We
saw the workmen place an empty tray, upside
down, over the filled one. Then, holding the
two together, they turned them over, and the
grapes dropped into the tray that had been
placed on top.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 59.&mdash;Drying Raisin Grapes.</span>
</div>

<p>During this drying time the people watch
the reports of the Weather Bureau. In some
places flags are displayed when rain is expected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
As a rule the grape season is over before the
rains begin.</p>

<p>When the grapes are taken from the trays,
they are placed in boxes holding about one
hundred pounds each.    These are called <i>sweat
boxes</i>. Here the driest grapes absorb some
of the moisture from the others, and the mass
becomes more uniform.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 60.&mdash;A Vineyard after being Pruned.</span>
</div>

<p>After the drying process has been   finished,
the stems are rather brittle. To make them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
softer and easier to handle, the grapes are next
placed in a cool room and left there for a time.</p>

<p>After visiting some of the vineyards, we
drove to one of the great packing establishments
in Fresno. These packing houses are
nearly always in the cities and towns, because
there help can be easily obtained. The
packing house that we visited employs four
hundred people, mostly girls and women.</p>

<p>The raisins are first placed on wooden or
metal frames the size of a raisin box. These
are called <i>forms</i>, and the packers are paid according
to the number of forms filled. When
these are filled, the raisins are carefully transferred
to the boxes.</p>

<p>A box of raisins weighs twenty pounds, but
there are half boxes and quarter boxes put up
also. A paper is placed on the bottom of each
box, and over the raisins another is placed. On
top of this there is a fancy paper on which the
name of the packer is stamped.</p>

<p>In most establishments there are three grades
of raisins, Imperial Clusters, London Layers,
and the loose and imperfect stems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>Sometimes a second crop of grapes is gathered
a little later in the fall. Of course these do not
dry so well because the days are shorter, it is
cooler, and rains sometimes occur. On this
account they are dipped in lye and then rinsed
in water. The lye cracks the skin, and so the
juice evaporates more quickly. These are called
Valencia raisins. There is not a very good
market for these, so that people do not dip
them so commonly now as they used to.</p>

<p>We saw the machine where the raisins are
<i>stemmed</i>. They pass from a hopper into a
space between two woven-wire cylinders. The
inner one revolves within the other. In this
way the raisins are broken from the stems.
They are then run through a fanning mill
which cleans them, and they are finally graded
by passing through screens having openings of
different sizes.</p>

<p>Most of the seedless raisins are made from
seedless grapes, but there are machines for
removing the seeds from the grapes which
contain them.</p>

<p>The superintendent of the packing house said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that nearly all of the raisins that we import
come from Spain, and that they are exported
chiefly from the city of Malaga.</p>

<p>The purple and other <i>wine grapes</i> are taken
to the wineries and sold by the ton, to be made
into wine.</p>

<p>There are many other things that I should
like to write about, but my letter is a pretty
long one now, so I will close.</p>

<h2>NUTTING</h2>


<p>Have you ever gone into the woods on a
beautiful autumn day? The bright, warm sunshine
floods the earth where the trees are far
apart and sifts down through the branches. All
nature seems to invite you to lie down under
a tree and dream. It was on such a day that
Rip Van Winkle fell into his long sleep.</p>

<p>How pretty the trees look in their fall suits
of yellow, crimson, red, and brown! What a
rustling is made as your feet tread the carpet
of leaves!</p>

<p>The breezes pass among the branches and
whisper a message to the bright-colored leaves.
They understand and obey. Singly, in groups,
and in showers, they silently float downward.
By night and by day they fall, but soon this
carpet will be changed for one of white.</p>

<p>Listen! The leaves are not the only things
that are falling. You can hear the <i>thump</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
<i>thump</i> of nuts as they drop from their lofty
perches in the walnut and hickory-nut trees.</p>

<p>Sit down quietly on that log and you will
soon see the busy nut gatherers. With their
tails curled over their backs, they race up and
down the trees, or spring from branch to branch,
carrying their precious burdens to their homes
in the hollows of trunk or limb. Now one sits
up straight, holding a nut between his paws,
and turning it slowly as he cracks and eats
it. If he sees you, he whisks out of sight, or
scolds you from a safe place far above the
ground.</p>

<p>When the winter winds are whistling through
the leafless trees, and snows are drifting over
the ground, these little nut gatherers feast to
their hearts' content.</p>

<p>The squirrels do not gather all of the nuts.
Children and grown people enjoy nutting.
When there are not enough nuts on the
ground, the men and boys climb the trees to
shake them off. Then everybody hunts among
the leaves for the treasures.</p>

<p>Some of the most important nuts are walnuts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
hickory nuts, hazelnuts, almonds, chestnuts,
Brazil nuts, pecans, and peanuts.</p>

<p>Many of the hickory nuts fall out of their
coverings bright and clean. Walnuts generally
have to be <i>shucked</i>, and the juice stains the
hands almost black.</p>

<p>As hazelnuts grow on bushes, they can be
easily picked. They usually drop out of their
burs after there have been a few frosts.</p>

<p>Many nuts are gathered in the woods, but
in some places the trees are cultivated just as
fruit trees are.</p>

<p>We usually eat nuts between meals, or as a
dessert. They are not simply dainties, but are
very valuable articles of food. In some countries
the poor people depend upon them for food.</p>

<p>In almost any city of our country are to be
found the nuts that I have mentioned, with
perhaps several other kinds. These have come
from different states, some from Canada, some
from Brazil, and some from Spain.</p>

<p>I am sure you will enjoy gathering nuts of
different kinds, so let us set out on a nutting
expedition.</p>

<h2>A WALNUT VACATION</h2>


<p>How would you like to have your school close
for two weeks, so that you could gather walnuts?
Every year many of the boys and girls of Southern
California are given a vacation just for this
purpose. It is called the "walnut vacation,"
and occurs in the month of October.</p>

<p>These children do not take their baskets and
go off to the woods where they can romp and
play, watch the squirrels, and gather beautiful
autumn leaves. They gather nuts from the
trees which their parents own, for in Southern
California there are many walnut ranches or
groves. You see the vacation means a vacation
for work instead of for play.</p>

<p>Walnut trees are set out in rows just as apple
trees are, but their roots and branches extend
to such a distance from the trunks that they
need to be about twice as far apart.</p>

<p>The walnut harvest, which begins about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
first of October, is a busy time. Men, women,
boys, and girls may be seen in the groves, shaking
the nuts from the trees, picking them up,
and putting them into sacks.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 61.&mdash;A Walnut Grove.</span>
</div>

<p>The men shake the trees, and there is a
shower of nuts to the earth. Do not go under
the branches now unless you want to be pelted.
A single tree has been known to yield three
hundred pounds of nuts in a season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>When the trees have been given a good shaking,
there are still some nuts clinging to the
branches. These are obtained by shaking the
limbs separately, by means of long poles, to
the ends of which wire hooks are fastened. As
all of the nuts do not ripen at the same time,
the trees are sometimes gone over two or three
times.</p>

<p>Now the boys, girls, and women go to work
filling pails and baskets and emptying them
into sacks, for they can do this work as well as
men.</p>

<p>Usually the nuts drop out of their covering or
<i>shuck</i> when they strike the ground; but if they
do not, the <i>shuck</i> must be removed. Sometimes
the covering is cut off. If you handle the nuts
with your bare hands, they will be stained
almost black, and you will have to let the color
wear off.</p>

<p>The days are bright and warm, and this sort
of nutting becomes rather tiresome before sundown.
The work must be done and the vacation
is not a very long one, so each does his
part cheerfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>When the nuts have been gathered, they are
taken to the shed or place where they are to be
washed. Here they are poured into a large
wire cylinder which revolves in a tank
filled with water. The machine is
turned by a horse walking round
and round, and it both washes
and grades the nuts. The smaller ones pass
through the meshes in the wire and are called
<i>second grade</i>. The larger ones are known as
<i>first grade</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 62.&mdash;Washing, Drying, and Sacking Walnuts.</span>
</div>

<p>When the walnuts come out of the washer,
they are spread out on shallow, wooden trays to
dry. Sometimes several thousand trays may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
seen on one ranch. They are loaded on to a
small car and pushed to the part of the field
where they are wanted.</p>

<p>If there is no foggy or cloudy weather, they
will dry in about five days, but if there is, it
may take ten.</p>

<p>After the nuts are thoroughly dried, the trays
are placed on the car and pushed to the <i>bleacher</i>.
This is a large box made of tarred paper. It
is placed over the trays, and a quantity of sulphur
is burned in it. This is simply to whiten
the shells, for they sell for a higher price when
they are bleached. Sometimes the nuts are
whitened by dipping them into a liquid preparation.</p>

<p>The nuts are now sacked and marked, ready
to ship. Soon after the boys and girls have
finished their "walnut vacation," the nuts are
on their way to the eastern part of the United
States.</p>

<p>Most of the walnuts raised in California have
soft shells. Some have such thin shells that
they are called "paper shells." The walnuts
that grow in the woods of Indiana, Illinois,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and other states have hard shells. They are
dark in color and are called <i>black walnuts</i>. The
trees are quite valuable, as the wood is used
in making furniture.</p>

<h2>CHESTNUTS</h2>


<p>Let us go on a chestnutting expedition to
the southern part of France. We can gather
the nuts in many of the states of our own
country, but the trip to a strange land will be
enjoyed by all.</p>

<p>The chestnut trees, many of which are very
old, spread their branches to great distances.
The nuts, as you see, are inclosed in a <i>bur</i> or
coat which covers the shell. There are generally
two nuts in each bur.</p>

<p>When <i>you</i> eat chestnuts, you eat them as a
sort of dainty, not as a regular article of food.
This is not the case in the home of Jean,
the boy who is helping his father fill those
sacks. In his home, as in many homes in
southern Europe, the nuts form one of the
chief articles of daily food.</p>

<p>In the winter Jean sells the freshly roasted
nuts on a street corner in the city of Lyons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
He gets a good many pennies each noon from
workmen and poor people generally, who use
them for their midday meal. He sells ten nuts
for a penny.</p>

<p>This is not the only way in which they are
eaten. Jean's mother boils them with celery
and mashes them as we do potatoes. The nuts
are also ground into a flour from which bread
is made. They are often used in the dressing
for fowls.</p>

<p>Confectioners use great quantities of chestnuts.
In Lyons there are establishments where
as many as two hundred persons are employed
in preparing them.</p>

<p>The nuts are first peeled, and then boiled in
clear water, which removes the thin coating
next the kernel. They are then placed in a
sirup flavored with Mexican vanilla, in which
they remain for about three days. After draining,
they are coated with vanilla or chocolate
and packed in attractive boxes. In this form
they are worth forty-five or fifty cents a
pound.</p>

<h2>A BAG OF PEANUTS</h2>


<p>Last summer Harry's parents took him with
them on a visit to Virginia. Harry has always
lived in New York City, and the country life
of the South was very interesting to him.</p>

<p>They visited friends who live on a beautiful
<i>plantation</i>, as the farms in the South are called.
A driveway lined with grand old trees leads
through the flower-studded lawn up to the
retired manor house, whose wide verandas
completely circle it round.</p>

<p>Beyond the house are the stables where work
horses, driving horses, and saddle horses are kept;
and beyond these is the pretty little boathouse,
standing on the bank of a small river that
winds its way through the plantation.</p>

<p>The morning after Harry arrived, his friend
Bert asked him if he would like to go across
the river to see the men harvest peanuts.</p>

<p>Now whenever Harry had wanted peanuts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
he had always gone to a stand and bought
a sack. He had never thought about where
they came from. He had heard of shaking
nuts from trees, so he supposed that they were
going to the woods.</p>

<p>He was therefore much surprised when Bert
took him to a field across the river where men
were plowing vines from the ground.</p>

<p>"Do peanuts grow in the ground?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Why, of course they do," answered Bert.</p>

<p>"I thought that nuts grew on trees," said
Harry.</p>

<p>"Father says that the peanut is not a <i>real</i>
nut," replied his friend. "He says they should
be called <i>ground nuts</i> or <i>ground peas</i>." He
pulled up one of the vines, and the boys threw
themselves down under a tree to examine it.</p>

<p>When the small clods of soil clinging to
the roots of the plant had been removed,
Harry saw a number of pods which he recognized
as peanuts.</p>

<p>Opening one of the pods, Bert took out the
kernels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>"These," said he, "are the <i>seeds</i>, and they
are planted much as other seeds are.</p>

<p>"Before they are planted the shell must be
removed, but we have to be careful not to break
the thin skin that covers the kernel. If that
be broken, the seed will not grow.</p>

<p>"The kernels are planted about one foot
apart, in rows that are, as you see, about three
feet apart. Sometimes they are planted by
hand and sometimes by machinery."</p>

<p>"I wonder if peanuts are raised in the
country around New York," said Harry.</p>

<p>"No, I think not," replied Bert, "for they
are very easily killed by frost. Great quantities
are raised in North Carolina and in Tennessee.
Father says that the negroes of western Africa
raised them long, long before they were known
in the United States. He says that they are
a very important article of food there, and
that whole villages take part in the planting
and harvesting.</p>

<p>"After the vines blossom," continued Bert,
"a very strange thing happens."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>"The flower stalks bend downward and push
themselves right into the soil, and on these
the pods develop. If the stalks do not enter
the earth within a few hours after the flowers
fall, they die."</p>

<p>Harry now watched the plowing. The plows
were drawn up and down the rows and ran
directly under the vines, lifting them out of
the soil. After they had been plowed out about
two hours, men took them upon pitchforks and
piled them up. Harry noticed that some of the
piles were covered with corn fodder, and asked
why this was. Bert told him that it was to
keep out the rain.</p>

<p>"What happens to the nuts after the vines
have been piled up?" said Harry.</p>

<p>"They remain in the piles fifteen or twenty
days, and are then spread out on the ground
or hauled to the barn, where the nuts are
picked off," answered Bert. "Sometimes they
are picked by hand and sometimes by machinery.
Let us go to the lower field; we
have an earlier variety there, and the nuts are
being picked now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>They found men, women, and children picking
the pods one by one and dropping them
into baskets. These were emptied into sacks.
Harry tried to lift one of these, and was surprised
to find it so heavy. Bert told him that
it weighed about one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>"Do you burn the vines after the nuts are
picked?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"No," said Bert, "they are fed to the cattle.
We call the vines <i>peanut hay</i>."</p>

<p>Bert explained that his father sold the sacks
of nuts to the factory, where they were cleaned
and sorted.</p>

<p>The next day the boys went to town and
visited the peanut factory.</p>

<p>The nuts were first put through a machine
which removed the dirt. They were then polished
and sorted into four grades. The poorest
grade is used in making peanut candy. The
nuts were then sacked, and were ready to be
shipped to the North.</p>

<p>Harry learned that an oil is made from the
nuts which is used as olive oil is used, and also
that peanut butter is produced from them. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
found that many men were employed on plantations
all through Virginia and other states of
the South, in raising the peanuts that are sold
on the streets of every city and town in our
country.</p>

<h2>ASSORTED NUTS</h2>


<p>After the Thanksgiving dinner had been
eaten, the nuts were passed, and the children
asked Uncle John to tell them something about
a few of them.</p>

<p>"All right," said he. "You pick out the
ones that you want to know about."</p>

<p>Frank handed him an almond.</p>

<p>"This nut," said Uncle John, "came from
sunny Spain. It grew not far from the blue
Mediterranean. Almonds are raised in most
parts of southern Europe and in the northern
part of Africa. Ages ago they grew in the Holy
Land, and are mentioned in the Bible."</p>

<p>"Do almonds grow in any part of our country?"
asked Helen.</p>

<p>"I think they grow in California," said
Frank.</p>

<p>"You are right," said Uncle John. "There
are many almond orchards in the southern part
of the state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>"An almond tree in full bloom is a beautiful
sight. The blossoms are white, tinted with
pink, and as they appear before the leaves do,
there is nothing to hide them."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/ill-p202.jpg" width="450" height="347" alt="Fig. 63.&mdash;Almond Trees in Full Bloom." title="Almond Trees in Full Bloom" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 63.&mdash;Almond Trees in Full Bloom.</span>
</div>

<p>"Does the nut have a covering?" inquired
Mary.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Uncle John. "When the
nut is ripe, the shuck opens gradually, and
sometimes the nuts fall out.</p>

<p>"When people have large orchards, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
spread pieces of canvas under the trees and then
shake them or beat them by means of long poles.</p>

<p>"The nuts that do not fall out of the shucks
are obtained by opening the shuck with a knife.
The nuts are then dried, and are ready for
market."</p>

<p>As soon as Uncle John had finished, Mary
handed him a hazelnut. "Please tell about
this one," said she.</p>

<p>"I have often gone hazel nutting when I was
a boy," said her uncle. "Hazelnuts grow on
bushes in thickets. They are six or eight feet
high and very slender. Baskets are sometimes
made of them, and I have often used them for
arrows.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the nuts grow singly, and sometimes
in groups of two or three. A bur covers
the nut, which sticks very closely until it is ripe.
Then the nuts often fall out.</p>

<p>"After I had gathered the hazelnuts, I used
to spread them out on the roof of the wood house
to dry."</p>

<p>"Nuts that look just like these are called
filberts," said Helen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>"Filberts are cultivated hazelnuts," replied
Uncle John; "they are larger than the wild
ones."</p>

<p>"I would like to know how this nut grows,"
said Helen, handing her uncle a black nut
shaped like a triangular prism.</p>

<p>"This," said Uncle John, "came from Brazil,
and is called a Brazil nut. Do you know where
Brazil is?"</p>

<p>"It is in the northeastern part of South
America," replied Helen.</p>

<p>"The great Amazon River is in Brazil, and
it flows through tropical forests," said Mary.</p>

<p>"Much of our coffee comes from Brazil," said
Frank.</p>

<p>Uncle John then told the children that
Brazil nuts come from the northern part of
Brazil and from the Orinoco valley.</p>

<p>Helen asked if they grow as walnuts and
hickory nuts do.</p>

<p>"No," answered her uncle, "they grow inside
of a great case or shell. There are from
eighteen to twenty-five in one shell, which is
nearly as large as a man's head."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>"How are the nuts got out of the shells?"
asked Mary.</p>

<p>"When they fall, men break them open and
take out the nuts," replied Uncle John. "Most
of them are sent down the Amazon to the city
of Para and from there shipped to the United
States and other countries."</p>

<p>None of the children knew where Para is
situated, so they all went to the library to
look at the atlas. After they had located it,
Uncle John told them of his visit to the city
and of the wonderful things which he saw on
a steamboat trip up the Amazon River.</p>

<h2>A STRANGE CONVERSATION</h2>


<p>One evening after I had been reading for
some time, I went to the kitchen to get a drink
of water. That part of the house was dark
and quiet, and as I stepped through the doorway,
I heard low, musical voices, apparently in
the pantry. I was very much surprised, you
may be sure, and I kept perfectly still, and
listened.</p>

<p>"Yes," said a voice, which I could barely
hear, "I am a long way from home indeed,
and sometimes it makes me quite lonely when
I think of it."</p>

<p>"Tell us about your home, and how you
lived," said another low voice.</p>

<p>"Well," began the first speaker, "my name
is <i>Pepper</i>. With twenty-five or thirty brothers
and sisters I grew in a cluster on a vine.
We were but a small part of the family, for
there were similar clusters all over our vine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
We were about as large as peas, and grew somewhat
after the fashion of currants.</p>

<p>"All about were other vines to which friends
and relatives were attached. Pepper vines are
always anxious to get to the top, and so some
of these vines climbed trees and some twined
themselves about poles, which men had set in
the ground for this purpose. Our vine was
three or four years old when we appeared on
it."</p>

<p>"How long did you live on the vine?" asked
a voice that I had not heard before.</p>

<p>"Only a few months," replied Pepper. "You
see, we had to make room for another set of
berries. Two sets appear each year for twenty
years or more.</p>

<p>"Under the influence of the tropical sunshine
and the warm rains we grew day by day,
and we were as happy as the butterflies and
birds about us. By and by we began to turn
red. All of this time a <i>hull</i> or coat was forming
on the outside of our bodies.</p>

<p>"Before we became entirely red, workmen
came to the field, and, by rubbing us between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
their hands, separated us from the stems to
which we lovingly clung.</p>

<p>"After having been picked, I was, with
many others, placed upon a mat to dry. These
mats were all about us, each covered with
berries. After being thoroughly dried we were
put into a mill and ground, and I became what
I am now, <i>Black Pepper</i>."</p>

<p>"Are there other kinds of pepper?" asked
some one.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Pepper, "there is <i>White
Pepper</i>, and <i>Red</i>, or <i>Cayenne Pepper</i>. Some
of my friends were made into White Pepper.
They were soaked in limewater for about two
weeks, and this, of course, softened and wrinkled
their hulls which had always fitted so nicely.
This was bad enough, but it was not the
worst."</p>

<p>"What happened next?" said several voices.</p>

<p>"They were then," continued Pepper, "trodden
under the bare feet of dark-skinned men,
and this rubbed off their hulls completely.
After this they were ground as we had been.</p>

<p>"Cayenne Pepper is not a member of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
family at all, although it has the same name.
I have looked up its genealogy, and I find that
it received its name from the city of Cayenne,
in French Guiana, near which it grows. It is in
the form of bell-shaped pods, and grows on low,
bushy plants instead of vines.</p>

<p>"The pods are green at first, but red when
ripe. No doubt you have seen strings of them
hanging in the grocery store when you were
on the shelves. People sometimes use the
pods as they are, but usually they are dried,
ground, mixed with yeast, and baked into flat
cakes like crackers. When these cakes are
ground, Red, or Cayenne Pepper, is produced.
It is put up in little boxes just as we are.</p>

<p>"Pepper used to be regarded as a great
luxury," the speaker went on. "Until the
eighteenth century the Portuguese handled almost
all of it. It was not uncommon for rents
to be paid with pepper. If any of you have
read ancient history, you know that when Alaric
took Rome he demanded, among other things,
one thousand pounds of pepper as a ransom.</p>

<p>"My home was in the East Indies," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Pepper, "but there are members of our family
living in the Philippines, India, Mexico,
the West Indies, and other tropical countries."</p>

<p>"Your story is a very interesting one," said
a voice, "and now, if you care to hear it, I will
tell something of my life."</p>

<p>"Yes, do tell us," said several at once.</p>

<p>"Very well, I will follow the example of
our friend Pepper and introduce myself at once.
I am known as Ginger. I have relatives living
in China, in India, and in the western part of
Africa, but I came from the West Indies. The
Ginger family is not like that of Pepper; it
has no lofty notions."</p>

<p>Pepper seemed a little inclined to get angry,
so Ginger hastened to say: "I mean that our
vines do not climb trees or poles, but run along
the ground. I was a <i>root</i> and not a <i>fruit</i>."</p>

<p>"When I was about a year old I, with countless
friends, was dug from the ground. We
were cut from the vines and put into vats of
scalding water."</p>

<p>"That was <i>dreadful</i>," said Pepper.</p>

<p>"We were treated in that way to prevent us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
from <i>sprouting</i>," continued Ginger. "After
being taken out of the water, we were thoroughly
dried and then ground. We were then
put up in cans and boxes and sold as <i>Black
Ginger</i>. Others were scraped before being
ground, and they were then called <i>White Ginger</i>.</p>

<p>"We were placed on board a great ship and
finally landed at New York. After remaining
in a large store there for some time, I was
brought to the corner grocery, and so I found
my way to this shelf.</p>

<p>"I am gradually wasting away, and I shall
not last a great while longer. In my tropical
home I seemed to be of no use to anybody,
while now I am called for frequently by the
cook, and my services seem to be appreciated,
so I am happy."</p>

<p>"To be of some real use in this world is the
greatest joy of life," remarked a strange voice.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then
Ginger said "May we not hear from you,
friend?"</p>

<p>"Your stories almost make me believe that I
am still in the land of my birth," was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>There was a peculiar little rattle about the
voice, which I recognized at once as belonging to
Cinnamon.</p>

<p>"For several years I was rocked to and fro
by gentle tropic breezes or lashed about by
storms. From my perch I could see beautiful
flowers, bright insects, and even serpents in the
thicket at my feet. Birds of brilliant plumage
often perched upon me. My home was on the
island of Ceylon.</p>

<p>"It is often said that where there is much
bark there is no bite. In my own case that is
not so."</p>

<p>"I was taken from one of the smaller limbs
of a cinnamon tree. I was slipped within a
larger piece of bark, for we each rolled up when
stripped from the limbs. A still larger piece
was slipped over us and so on until quite a
bundle had been formed. Some were quite
short, and some were three feet in length.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>"</p>

<p>"As a concise and interesting history of California, it
deserves a place in our schools and libraries, so that every
child may read it."&mdash;<i>Pacific Churchman.</i></p>

<p>"This volume comprises some excellent contributions to
history, as it certainly comprises some notable contributions
to romance. The little book is one which will appeal,
therefore, to readers old and young. Several of the stories
explain in some degree the remarkable physical characteristics
of California, but the writer's chief aim has been to
unfold to children and their parents the life of bygone
days."&mdash;<i>The Outlook.</i></p>

It is correctly conceived and admirably executed. The subject is

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
